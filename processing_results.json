Standards for consideration of applications. \n In considering applications for the subdivision of land, the Planning Board shall be \nguided by the following standards, which standards shall be considered to be minimum \nrequirements and shall be waived by the Planning Board only under circumstances set forth in \n§20-56. \n \n(a)  In granting or withholding approval of such a subdivision plat, the Planning Board will \nconsider: \n \n(1)  Whether there is adequate provision and access for a separate sewer connection and \na separate water service line to each principal building to be erected on such lots, \nblock or sites. \n \n(2)  Method whereby such lots, blocks or sites are proposed to be drained. \n \n(3)  The property shall be such that it can safely be used for the building purposes \ncontemplated by the plan without danger to health or peril from fire, flood or other \nmenace, taking into consideration its location, elevation, grade and drainage. \n \n(4)  Whether there is any reasonable basis for assuming that a street will later be opened \nadjacent to any part of such lot and, if so, whether the proposed use might interfere \nwith any such street or result in any noncompliance with the provisions of the \nZoning Code in the event any such street is later opened. \n \n(5)  Whether the proposed use will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent \nof the Zoning Code and consistent with the public health, safety and the general \nwelfare. \n \n(6)  Monuments, curbs, gutters, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains, street and \nother paving, streetlights and other improvements, including, if required by the \nPlanning Board, sidewalks and street trees, fire hydrants, fire alarms and fire alarm \ncables, shall be installed, all in accordance with these regulations and standards and \nwith specifications and procedures acceptable to the appropriate departments of the \ncity. \n \n (7) A storm drainage system shall be provided adequate to dispose of all stormwater \nfrom the property and to protect other property owners from any damage from such \nstormwater and so designed as not to cause silting or clogging of existing city storm \ndrains.  \n \n (8) The Planning Board shall, wherever possible, require the preservation of all natural \nfeatures which add value to residential developments and to the community, such as \nlarge trees or groves, watercourses and falls, beaches, historic spots, vistas and \nsimilar irreplaceable assets. In general, all trees on the site except those within \nproposed building sites, and for a distance of 10 feet therefrom, shall be preserved. \n  \n\nJanuary 21, 2025     Page 18 \n       Item No. 2 \n       Ordinance No. \n \n \n \nSec. 20-56. Waivers and Modifications. \n(a) Where the Planning Board finds that extraordinary and unnecessary hardships may result \nfrom strict compliance with these regulations, it may vary said regulations so that \nsubstantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that such \nvariations will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the Official Map \nand the Comprehensive Plan or the Zoning law.  \n \n(b) In granting waivers and modifications, the Planning Board shall require such conditions \nas will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards or \nrequirements so varied or modified. \n \nSec. 20-57. Action on and Filing of Subdivision Plat. \n(a) The Planning Board shall, within 30 days from the date of the filing of the findings \nstatement for a subdivision requiring an EIS, or within 62 days of the close of the public \nhearing for a subdivision not requiring an EIS, approve, approve with modifications or \ndisapprove the subdivision plat \n \n(b) Approval or disapproval of a waiver of filing requirements takes place simultaneously. \nAny approved subdivision for which map filing requirements have been waived shall be \nrecorded with the City Clerk along with any conditions of approval attached thereto. \n \n(c) Upon compliance by the applicant with the requirements of Sections 20-53 and 20-54 \nhereof, the Chairman and Secretary of the Planning Board are authorized to sign the \nstatement on the plat plan. The subdivision plat is now ready for filing in the Division of \nLand Records, Nassau County, New York. Section 32 of the General City Law requires \nthe plan to be filed within ninety (90) days of the date of the resolution of the Planning \nBoard approving the plan. The law allows the Planning Board to extend this time for two \n(2) periods of ninety (90) days each. The subdivision plan must be filed for the approval \nof the Planning Board to become effective. \n \n(d) Approval of a subdivision plat subject to conditions set forth by the Planning Board in its \nresolution shall constitute a conditional approval of the plat. Conditional approval does \nnot qualify the final plat for recording. At the time of the resolution conditionally \napproving the plat, the Planning Board must empower a duly authorized officer of the \nPlanning Board to sign the plat upon completion of the requirements stated in the \nresolution. \n  \n\nJanuary 21, 2025     Page 19 \n       Item No. 2 \n       Ordinance No. \n \n \n(e). No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions shall be made in any subdivision plat \nafter approval has been given by the Board and endorsed, in writing, on the plat, unless \nsaid plat is first resubmitted to the Board. In the event that any such subdivision plat is \nrecorded without complying with this requirement, the same shall be considered null and \nvoid, and the Board shall institute proceedings to have the plat stricken from the records \nof the County Clerk. Minor modifications may be approved by the Board without the \nnecessity of a formal review procedure under these regulations. In such instances public \nhearing and fees required by this chapter shall be waived.” \n \n  Sec. 6.

Tenant may, however, at Tenant’s expense, \nmake a separate claim to the appropriate Authority for the value of Tenant’s Property and for \nmoving expenses, provided such claim and award, if any, do not result in a reduction of the \naward which would otherwise be paid to Landlord.  If a taking does not result in the termination \nof this lease (i) Landlord shall, at Landlord’s expense, as soon as practicable, restore that part of \nthe Premises or the Real Property not taken to the extent reasonably practicable, so that the \nPremises are usable, and (ii) from and after the date of the vesting of title, the Rent shall be \nreduced in the same proportion as the area of the Premises, if any, which was taken. \nArticle 14.

Remedies \nSection 17.1 If this lease is terminated pursuant to Article 17   or Landlord \nreenters or obtains possession of the Premises by summary proceedings or any other legal action \nor by force or otherwise (which Landlord may do without further notice and without liability or \nobligation to Tenant or any occupant of the Premises), all of the provisions of this Section shall \napply (in addition to any other applicable provisions of this lease). \n(a) Tenant, and all other occupants, shall vacate and surrender to Landlord the \nPremises in accordance with this lease. \n(b) Landlord, at Landlord’s option, may (i) relet the Premises, or any portion \nof the Premises, from time to time, in the name of Landlord, Tenant or otherwise, as determined \nby Landlord, to any person and on any terms, but Landlord shall have no obligation to relet the \nPremises, or any portion of the Premises, or to collect any rent (and the failure to relet the \nPremises, or any portion of the Premises, or to collect any rent shall not impose any liability or \nobligation on Landlord or relieve Tenant of any obligation or liability under this lease), and (ii) \nmake any changes to the Premises as Landlord, in Landlord’s judgment, considers advisable or \nnecessary in connection with a reletting, without imposing any liability or obligation on Landlord \nor relieving Tenant of any obligation or liability under this lease. \n(c) Tenant shall pay Landlord all Rent payable to the date on which this lease \nis terminated or Landlord re-enters or obtains possession of the Premises. \n(d) Tenant shall also pay to Landlord, as damages, any deficiency between (i) \nthe aggregate Rent for the period which otherwise would have constituted the unexpired portion \nof the Term (conclusively presuming the monthly Additional Rent for each year thereof to be \n1/12\nth\n of Additional Rent that was payable for the year immediately preceding the termination, \nre-entry or obtaining of possession) and (ii) the rents, if any, applicable to that period collected \nunder any reletting of all or any portion of the Premises.  Tenant shall pay any deficiency in \nmonthly installments on the days specified in this lease for payment of installments of the Fixed \nRent, and Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant each monthly deficiency as the same \narises.  No suit to collect the deficiency for any month shall prejudice Landlord’s right to collect \nthe deficiency for any subsequent month.  Tenant shall not be entitled to any rents payable \n(whether or not collected) under any reletting, whether or not those rents exceed the Rent. If \nLandlord relets the Premises, or any portion of the Premises, together with other space in the \nBuilding, the rents collected under the reletting and the expenses of the reletting shall be \nequitably apportioned for the purposes of this Article.  \n(e) Landlord may recover from Tenant, and Tenant shall pay Landlord, on \nrequest, in lieu of any further deficiency pursuant to the preceding paragraph of this Section (as \nliquidated damages for such deficiency) the amount by which (i) the unpaid Rent for the period \nwhich otherwise would have constituted the unexpired portion of the Term (conclusively \npresuming the Addit io nal Rent for each year thereof to be the same as was payable for the year \nimmediately preceding the termination, re-entry or obtaining of possession) exceeds (ii) the then \nfair market rental value of the Premises, including the Addit ional Rent for the same period, both \ndiscounted to present value at an annual rate of interest equal to five (5%) percent.  If, before \n\n \n \n- 19 - \npresentation of proof of liquidated damages, Landlord relets the Premises or any portion of the \nPremises for any period pursuant to a bona fide lease with an unrelated third party, the net rents \n(after deducting reletting costs) payable in connection with the reletting shall be considered to be \nthe fair market rental value for the Premises or the portion of the Premises relet during the term \nof the reletting.   \n(f) Tenant shall also pay Landlord, as additional damages, any expenses \nincurred by Landlord in connection with the termination, reentry or obtaining of possession, and \nthe reletting of the Premises, including all repossession costs, brokerage commissions, \nreasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, alteration costs and other expenses of preparing \nthe Premises for reletting.   \n(g) Nothing contained in this lease shall be considered to limit or preclude the \nrecovery by Landlord from Tenant of the maximum amount allowed to be obtained as damages \nor otherwise by any Laws. \nSection 17.2 Tenant hereby waives (a) the service of any notice of intention to \nre-enter or obtain possession of the Premises or to institute any legal action in connection \ntherewith, except as provided in this lease and (b) on its own behalf and on behalf of all persons \nclaiming under Tenant, including all creditors, any rights Tenant and all such persons might \notherwise have under any Laws to redeem the Premises, to re-enter or repossess the Premises, or \nto restore this lease, after (i) Tenant is dispossessed pursuant to any Laws or by any Authority, \n(ii) Landlord reenters or obtains possession of the Premises, or (iii) the Expiration Date, whether \nby operation of law or pursuant to this lease.  The words “re-enter,” “re-entry” and “re-entered” \nas used in this lease shall not be considered to be restricted to their technical legal meanings. \nLandlord shall have the right to enjoin any Default and the right to invoke any remedy allowed \nby any Laws in addition to any remedies provided in this lease.  All remedies provided in this \nlease are cumulative and Landlord’s right to invoke, or the invocation of, any remedy shall not \npreclude Landlord from invoking any other remedy under this lease or under any and all Laws. \nSection 17.3 Landlord and Tenant each hereby waive trial by jury in any legal \naction brought by either party against the other in connection with this lease. If Landlord \ncommences any summary proceeding against Tenant, Tenant shall not interpose any \ncounterclaim in that proceeding, and shall not seek to consolidate the proceeding with any other \nlegal action. \nSection 17.4 Tenant expressly waives its right to bring any declaratory \njudgment action with respect to any provision of this Lease or with respect to any notice sent \npursuant to the provisions of this Lease.  Tenant expressly waives its right to obtain any type of \ninjunctive relief in connection to any provision of this Lease or with respect to any notice sent \npursuant to the provisions of this Lease.  Tenant expressly waives its right to make any \napplication for relief pursuant to First Nat. Stores, Inc. v. Yellowstone Shopping Center, Inc., 21 \nN.Y.2d 630 (1968), commonly referred to as a Yellowstone injunction.  Tenant’s breach of this \nparagraph, in any way, shall constitute a breach of substantial obligations of the tenancy, and \nshall be grounds for the immediate termination of this Lease, without any notice.  It is the \nexpress intention of the parties hereto that their disputes be adjudicated exclusively via summary \nproceedings in the City Court of the City of Long Beach. \n\n \n \n- 20 - \nSection 17.5 If Tenant fails to comply with any of its obligations under this \nlease, Landlord may, at its option, cure such breach of this lease.  All costs and expenses, \nincluding reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred by Landlord in that connection \nshall be paid by Tenant to Landlord as Additional Rent within fifteen (15) days after Tenant is \nbilled therefor.  Reasonable attorneys’ fees shall be calculated by usage of the lodestar method. \nSection 17.6  Tenant shall also reimburse Landlord for all costs and expenses  \n(including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements), incurred by Landlord in connection \nwith a default by Tenant, including instituting, prosecuting and/or defending any legal action by \nor against Tenant whether a non-payment or holdover proceeding, or other proceeding, if \nLandlord prevails in such legal action, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate \n(hereinafter defined).  \nSection 17.7 The failure of Landlord to seek redress for a Default, or of \nLandlord or Tenant to insist upon the strict performance of any term of this lease, shall not \nprevent Landlord from redressing a subsequent Default or Landlord or Tenant from thereafter \ninsisting on strict performance.  The receipt by Landlord of the Rent with knowledge of a \nDefault or Tenant’s failure to strictly perform under this lease shall not be deemed a waiver of \nthe Default or failure.  No term of this lease shall be considered waived by Landlord or Tenant \nunless the waiver is in a writing signed by the waiving party.  No payment by Tenant or receipt \nby Landlord of a lesser amount than the Rent shall be considered other than on account of the \nnext installment of the Rent, or as Landlord may elect to apply same.  No endorsement or \nstatement on any check or letter accompanying any check or payment shall prevent Landlord \nfrom cashing the check or otherwise accepting the payment, without prejudice to Landlord’s \nright to recover the balance of the Rent or pursue any other remedy. \nSection 17.8 If Tenant fails to pay any installment of the Fixed Rent or any \nAdditional Rent within five (5) days after the due date thereof, in addition to any other right or \nremedy of Landlord, Tenant shall pay to Landlord within fifteen (15) days following Landlord’s \ninvoice (a) a late charge equal to the greater of one hundred ($100.00) dollars and four (4%) \npercent of the amount unpaid and (b) interest at the rate (the “Default Rate”) of twelve (12%) \npercent per annum on the amount unpaid, from the date the payment was first due to and \nincluding the date paid and, (c) and Landlord’s bank charges for the return of any Tenant’s \ncheck. \nSection 17.9 All legal actions relating to this lease shall be adjudicated in the \ncourts of the State of New York having jurisdiction in the county in which the Building is \nlocated.  Tenant irrevocably consents to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of those \ncourts in any legal action relating to this lease or any guaranty of Tenant’s obligations under this \nlease, and Tenant shall not assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any objection to \nany such court being the venue of such legal action or claim that such venue is an inconvenient \nforum for Tenant or any principal of Tenant.   \nArticle 18. Security \nSection 18.1 Tenant has deposited with Landlord, as security for Tenant’s \ncompliance with this lease, the Security, in cash.  If Tenant defaults in performing any of its \nobligations under this lease, Landlord may use all or any portion of the Security to cure such \nbreach or for the payment of any other amount due and payable from Tenant to Landlord in \n\n \n \n- 21 - \naccordance with this lease. If Tenant shall, during any twelve (12) month period, twice be in \nbreach of its obligation to pay Rent on the first of the month, Tenant shall promptly after \nLandlord’s request, remit to Landlord an amount equal to six months of the then current amount \nof the monthly installment of Fixed Rent so that the amount of Security required under this lease \nshall then be equal to eight months’ of then current Fixed Rent.  If Landlord uses all or any part \nof the Security, Tenant shall, within fifteen (15) days following Landlord’s notice, deposit with \nLandlord an amount sufficient to restore the full amount of the Security. Landlord shall not, \nunless required by any Laws, pay interest to Tenant on the Security, and if Landlord is required \nto maintain the Security in an interest bearing account or pay any interest to Tenant, Landlord \nshall retain the maximum amount of interest permitted under any Laws (which Landlord may \nwithdraw and retain annually or at any other times).  Tenant shall not assign or encumber the \nSecurity, and no prohibited assignment or encumbrance by Tenant of the Security shall bind \nLandlord.  Landlord shall not be required to exhaust its remedies against Tenant or the Security \nbefore having recourse to Tenant, any Guarantor, the Security or any other security held by \nLandlord, or before exercising any right or remedy, and recourse by Landlord to any one of \nthem, or the exercise of any right or remedy, shall not affect Landlord’s right to pursue any other \nright or remedy or Landlord’s right to proceed against the others.  If there is then no uncured \nbreach, the Security and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, or any balance, shall be paid or \ndelivered to Tenant promptly after the Expiration Date and Tenant’s vacating of the Premises in \naccordance with this lease.  If Landlord’s interest in the Real Property is sold or leased, Landlord \nshall transfer the Security and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, or any balance, to the \nnew Landlord and, upon such transfer, the assignor shall thereupon be automatically released by \nTenant from all liability for the return of the Security or any interest (and Tenant agrees to look \nsolely to the assignee for the return of the Security or any interest). \nSection 18.2 Notwithstanding any other provision of this lease to the contrary, \nTenant may, at any time except if a Default has occurred, substitute the cash Security with an \nirrevocable, unconditional, “clean”, “evergreen” (i.e. automatic renewal) letter of credit in form \nand substance acceptable to Landlord, issued by a federally insured bank with a Standard & \nPoor’s credit rating of at least AA, whose office for the presentation of a letter of credit to be \ndrawn upon is in Nassau County or New York City and is reasonably acceptable to Landlord.    \nTenant shall keep any such letter of credit, including without limitation such amendments or \nreplacements as are necessary to increase the amount of the letter of credit as the amount of the \nrequired Security increases and after Landlord has drawn on the letter of credit, in full force and \neffect for not less than sixty (60) days after the Expiration Date of the Term.  Landlord may draw \nupon the letter of credit in whole or in part and apply the proceeds for the same reasons, and in \nthe same manner, as the cash Security. In addition, Landlord may draw upon the letter of credit if \n(a) Tenant has not supplied an amendment or replacement at least ninety (90) days prior to (i) the \nexpiry date, if any, or (ii) the date on which the amount of  the letter of credit is required to be \nincreased; (b) Landlord asks the letter of credit issuer to confirm the current expiry date and the \nissuer does not do so within ten (10) days after Landlord’s request; (c) Tenant fails to pay any \nbank charges with respect to any Landlord transfer of the letter of credit; (d) the issuer ceases, or \nannounces that it will cease, to maintain an office in New York City where Landlord may present \ndraw requests; or (e) the letter of credit issuer has a credit rating by Standard & Poor’s of less \nthan AA and, within thirty (30) days following Landlord’s notification to Tenant that the letter of \ncredit issuer’s Standard & Poor’s credit rating is less than AA, Tenant has not provided Landlord \nwith a replacement letter of credit from an issuer with a Standard & Poor’s credit rating of at \nleast AA. Tenant shall not seek to enjoin, prevent or otherwise interfere with Landlord’s draw \nagainst the letter of credit. Tenant acknowledges that the only effect of an erroneous draw would \n\n \n \n- 22 - \nbe to substitute cash Security for the letter of credit, which would not cause Tenant any legally \nrecognizable damage. The letter of credit shall provide that the letter of credit is freely \ntransferable by Landlord, its successors and assigns, as its beneficiary without payment by \nLandlord (or any subsequent transferee) of any fee or other consideration for such transfer. If \nLandlord transfers its interest in the Premises, Tenant shall, at Tenant’s expense, within ten (10) \ndays after receipt of Landlord’s request, deliver to Landlord or its transferee, an amendment to \nthe letter of credit naming Landlord’s transferee as substitute beneficiary of the letter of credit. \nArticle 19. Broker \nSection 19.1 Tenant represents to Landlord that it has dealt with no broker in \nconnection with this lease.  Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord fro m and \nagainst any claims for any brokerage commissions or other compensation which are made by any \nbroker alleging to have dealt with Tenant in connection with this lease, and all costs, expenses, \nliabilities and damages in connection therewith, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and \nexpenses.  Landlord shall pay any commission due the Broker pursuant to a separate agreement \nbetween Landlord and the Broker.  Landlord shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Tenant \nfrom and against all claims, costs, expenses, liabilities and damages including reasonable \nattorneys’ fees and expenses (a) arising fro m Landlord’s failure to comply wit h its obligat ion in \nthe preceding sentence and (b) any claims for any brokerage commissions or other compensation \nby any broker (other than the Broker) with whom Landlord, but not Tenant, has had dealings in \nconnection with this lease.  \nArticle 20. Notices; Consents and Approvals \nSection 20.1 Except as may be provided in this lease, all notices and other \ncommunications under this lease must be in writing and sent by nationally recognized overnight \ncourier service or registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), addressed to Landlord or \nTenant at its Notice Address.  Either party may, by notice given in accordance with this Article, \ndesignate a different Notice Address, which address change shall become effective upon receipt, \nthe date rejected or the date of attempted delivery (if the receiving party is not present). \nSection 20.2 Any notice or other communication sent as provided in this Article \nshall be effective (a) on the date received, the date rejected, or the date of attempted delivery (if \nthe receiving party is not present) if sent by overnight courier service, or (b) three (3) business \ndays after mailing by registered or certified mail.   \nSection 20.3 If any provision of this lease requires Landlord’s consent or \napproval, such consent or approval shall be effective only if given in writing.  Notwithstanding \nany provision of this lease to the contrary, any type of Landlord’s consent shall be provided at \nthe sole discretion of the Landlord. \nSection 20.4 Any notice or other communication given by Landlord to Tenant in \naccordance with this Article may be signed and given by Landlord’s attorney or managing agent, \nif any, with the same force and effect as if signed and given by Landlord. \nArticle 21.

This lease contains the entire agreement between Landlord and \nTenant with respect to the subject matter of this lease, and any previous agreements between \nLandlord and Tenant are merged in this lease, which alone expresses their agreement.  Tenant is \nentering into this lease after full investigation, and is not relying on any warranties, \nrepresentations, statements or promises made by Landlord or any other person not expressly set \nforth in this lease, and is not acquiring any rights of any nature, by implication or otherwise, \nexcept as expressly set forth in this lease. \nSection 21.2 Any employee of Landlord, Landlord’s managing agent, if any, or \nthe Real Property to whom any property is entrusted by or on behalf of Tenant shall be deemed \nto be acting as Tenant’s agent with respect to that property and neither Landlord nor Landlord’s \nmanaging agent, if any, shall be liable for any damages to or loss of property of Tenant or others \nentrusted to employees, agents or contractors of Landlord, Landlord’s managing agent, if any, or \nthe Real Property. \nSection 21.3 Neither Landlord nor Landlord’s managing agent, if any, shall be \nliable for any injury, damage or loss to Tenant, Tenant’s Property, Tenant’s Work, Tenant’s \nbusiness or to any other person or property resulting from any cause, except to the extent caused \nby the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, Landlord’s managing agent, if any, or their \nrespective employees, agents or contractors, subject to Section 13.4. \nSection 21.4 In the event of a transfer or lease of the entire Building (a) the \ntransferor or lessor shall be and hereby is relieved of all obligations and liabilities of Landlord \nunder this lease accruing after the effective date of the transfer or lease, and (b) the transferee or \nlessee shall be deemed to have assumed all of Landlord’s obligations and liabilities under this \nlease effective from and after the effective date of the transfer or lease. \nSection 21.5 In no event shall Landlord, its affiliates, agents, partners, members, \nmanagers, shareholders, officers, directors and principals, disclosed or undisclosed, be liable for \nincidental or consequential damages or have any   personal liability under or in connection with \nthis lease.  Tenant shall look only to Landlord’s interest in the Real Property for the satisfaction \nof Tenant’s remedies or to collect any judgment requiring the payment of money by Landlord \nunder or in connection with this lease, and no other assets of Landlord or such persons shall be \nsubject to lien, levy, execution or other enforcement procedure for the satisfaction of Tenant’s \nremedies or the collection of any judgment under or in connection with this lease.  If Tenant \nacquires a lien on such other property or assets by judgment or otherwise, Tenant shall promptly \nrelease that lien by signing, acknowledging and delivering to Landlord any instrument, prepared \nby Landlord, required for the lien to be released. \nSection 21.6 If Tenant requests Landlord’s consent or approval and Landlord \nfails or refuses to give such consent or approval, Tenant shall not be entitled to any damages for \nany withholding by Landlord of its consent or approval.  \nSection 21.7 This lease and the obligations of Tenant to pay the Rent and \nperform Tenant’s other obligations under this lease are separate, distinct and independent of \nLandlord’s obligations under this lease. \nSection 21.8 Tenant’s obligations shall not be waived, delayed or otherwise \naffected in any manner, and Landlord shall have no liability, if Landlord is unable to comply \n\n \n \n- 24 - \nwith, or is delayed in complying with, any of Landlord’s obligations under this lease by reason of \nany strike, labor trouble, accident, war, government action, Laws or other cause beyond \nLandlord’s control.   \nSection 21.9 Tenant shall not perform or permit to be performed any act which \nmay subject Landlord, its partners, members, managers, shareholders, officers, directors and \nprincipals or Landlord’s managing agent, if any, to any liability.

In addition, Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for per diem use and occupancy in \nrespect of the Premises at a rate equal to twice the Rent payable under this lease for the last year \nof the Term (which Landlord and Tenant agree is the Rent that is contemplated by them as being \nfair and reasonable under such circumstances and is not a penalty).  In no event, however, shall \nthis Section be construed as permitting Tenant (and all other occupants) to remain in possession \nof the Premises after the Expiration Date. \nSection 22.3 If during the last ninety (90) days of the Term, Tenant removes \nsubstantially all of Tenant’s Property from the Premises, Landlord or any person designated by \nLandlord may immediately enter and alter the Premises, without releasing Tenant from any \nobligation or liability under this lease, including the payment of Rent, or incurring any liability \nor obligation to Tenant. \n\n \n \n- 25 - \nSection 22.4 Unless otherwise specifically provided:  (a) any obligation of \nLandlord or Tenant under this lease which by its nature or under the circumstances can only be, \nor by the terms of this lease may be, performed after the Expiration Date; (b) any liability for a \npayment with respect to any period ending on or before the Expiration Date; and, (c) all \nindemnity and hold harmless provisions in this lease, shall survive the Expiration Date. \nArticle 23.

Until the repairs to be performed by Landlord \nare  substantially  completed,  the  Rent  shall  be  reduced  in  proportion  to  the  area  of  the  \nPremises to which Tenant shall not have reasonable access or which is unusable by Tenant \nfor the reasonable conduct of Tenant’s normal business in the Premises and which Tenant \ndoes not actually use. \nSection 11.2 If (a) the Premises are rendered wholly untenable, or (b) the \nPremises are damaged by any cause which is not covered by Landlord’s insurance, or (c) \nthe Premises are damaged in whole or in part during the last two (2) years of the Term, or \n(d)  the  cost  of  repairing  any  damage  to  the  Building  by  fire  or  other  casualty  exceeds\nseventy-five percent (75%) of the replacement cost thereof,  as reasonably estimated by a\nreputable contractor, architect  or  engineer  selected  by  Landlord,  Landlord  shall  have  the\nright, by notice given to Tenant within sixty (60) days following the date of the damage, to\nterminate  this  lease.    If  this  lease  is  terminated  pursuant  to  this  Section,  the  Term  shall\nexpire on the fifteenth (15th) day after the notice is given as fully and completely as if such\ndate were the stated Expiration Date.\nSection 11.3 This Article constitutes an express agreement governing any \ndamage  to  or  destruction  of  the  Premises  or  the  Building  by  fire  or  other  casualty,  and  \nSection 227 of the Real Property Law of the State of New York, and any other similar Laws \nshall have no application to a fire or other casualty. \nArticle 12. A\nssignment and No Subletting \nSection 12.1 Except as provided in this Article, Tenant shall not, without \nLandlord’s prior consent, assign, encumber or otherwise transfer this lease or any interest \nin this lease, by operation of law or otherwise, or sublet or permit others to occupy all or \nany part of the Premises,  or license concessions or lease departments in the Premises, and \nany assignment,   encumbrance,   transfer,   sublet,   occupancy   agreement,   license   or   \ndepartment lease shall be void ab initio if not in accordance with this Article.  The transfer \nor  issuance  (by  one  or  more  related  or  unrelated  transactions)  of  ownership  interests  of  \nTenant, or any Guarantor,  or any direct or indirect owner of  Tenant,  which results in 50 \npercent  or  more  of  the  ownership  interests  of  that  person  being  held  by  persons  who  did  \nnot hold 50 percent or more of those ownership interests on the date of this lease shall be \nconsidered  an  assignment  of  this  lease  which  requires  Landlord’s  consent,  unless  such  \nownership interests are publicly traded on a national stock exchange or over-the-counter \nmarket.   \nSection 12.2 Notwithstanding any provision of this lease to the contrary, \nSubletting  of  the  Premises  contained  in  this  lease  is  expressly  forbidden  without  the  \nLandlord’s prior written consent,  subject to the Landlord’s sole discretion.   \nSection 12.3 If  Tenant  desires to  assign  this  lease,  then  upon  Landlord’s \nreceipt  of  the  Consent  Request  (hereinafter  defined),  together  with  the  documents  and  \ninformation required under Section 12.4(d), Landlord may, at its option, elect to terminate \n\n- 17\n -\nthis  lease by notice given to Tenant, which notice shall specify a date for the termination \nof this lease (the “Recapture Termination Date”).  Such option shall be exercised by giving \nTenant  notice  of  exercise  within  thirty  (30) days  after  the  date  Landlord  receives  the  \nConsent Request and the documents and information required under Section 12.4(d).  The \nRecapture Termination Date shall be a date no earlier than two (2) months and no later than \nfour (4) months after the date the Consent Request and such supplemental documents and \ninformation are delivered to Landlord.  Upon the Recapture Termination Date, this  lease \nand the term thereof shall end and expire as fully and completely as if such date were the \ndate set forth herein as the stated Expirat ion Date.  Tenant shall thereupon quit, surrender \nand vacate the Premises,  without  prejudice,  however,  to Landlord’s  rights  and  remedies  \nagainst Tenant under the lease provisions in effect prior to the Recapture Termination Date \nor  with  respect  to  periods  prior  to  the  Recapture Termination  Date,  and  any  Rent  owing  \nshall be paid up to such date and any payments of Rent  made  by  Tenant  which  were  on  \naccount of any period subsequent to such date shall be returned to Tenant.  If Landlord so \nterminates this lease, Landlord may, at its option and without liability to Tenant, lease the \nPremises to any person or entity that was negotiating with Tenant or that signed a lease, \nsublease or assignment agreement with Tenant for the Premises.  \nSection 12.4 Tenant  acknowledges  that  the  character  and  nature  of  the  \nconcessions, concession management and operations within the Building are important to \nLandlord  and  to  the  success  of  the  Premises.    Therefore,  the  Landlord  may  grant  an  \nassignment of this lease subject to its sole discretion and judgment.  Any such assignment \nmust comply with the foregoing: \n(a)Such  assignee  shall  use  and  occupy  the  Premises  only  for  the\nPermitted Use. \n(b)Such assignment shall not, in Landlord’s judgment, adversely affect\nthe quality and type of business operation which Tenant has conducted theretofore at the \nPremises in compliance with the provisio ns of this lease. \n(c)The  principal(s)  of  such  assignee  shall  possess  qualifications  for\noperating Tenant’s business that are substantially equivalent to Tenant’s qualifications, and \nhave demonstrated recognized experience in successfully operating such a business. \n(d)Tenant delivers   to Landlord   a   written   request   (the   “Consent\nRequest”)  for  Landlord’s  consent  which  shall  include  (i)   the  name  and  address  of  the  \nproposed assignee, (ii) the nature and character of the business of the proposed subtenant \nor  assignee,  (iii)  current  bank,  financial  and  other  credit  information  on  the  proposed  \nsubtenant  or  assignee,  and  (iv)  a  copy  of  the  proposed  assignment  or  sublease,  fully  \nexecuted, which assignment or sublease shall be in compliance with the requirements of \nthis  Article.    Tenant shall promptly supply Landlo rd with  such  addit ional  informat ion  as  \nLandlord may reasonably request. \n(e)At the time of such assignment, there is no Default.\n\n- 18 \n-\n(f)Tenant reimburses Landlord on demand for any out-of-pocket costs\nincurred   by   Landlord   in   connection   with   said   assignment,   including   the   costs   of   \ninvestigating the proposed assignee or subtenant and Landlord’s reasonable legal costs. \n(g)If  Tenant  assigns  this  lease,  Tenant  delivers  to  Landlord  a  fully\nexecuted  assignment  and  assumption  agreement,  duly  acknowledged,   in   form   and   \nsubstance reasonably satisfactory to Landlord.   \n(h)If Tenant subleases the Premises, Tenant delivers to Landlord a fully\nexecuted sublease, in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, that, among other things, \nprovides that: (i) the sublease is subject and subordinate to this lease and to the matters to \nwhich this lease is or shall be subject and subordinate; (ii) the subtenant shall not, without \nLandlord’s  prior consent  or  approval,  take  any  action,  which,  if  to  be  taken  by  Tenant,  \nwould require Landlord’s consent or approval; (iii) the subtenant shall, upon notice from \nLandlord that Tenant is then in default of this lease, pay the rent under the sublease directly \nto Landlord, to be applied to the Rent under this lease (and Tenant hereby consents to that \npayment and agrees that any such payment shall be credited against the subtenant’s  rent  \nobligation under the sublease); (iv) the subtenant shall carry the insurance,  and furnish to \nLandlord the evidence thereof,  required by this lease to be carried and furnished by Tenant, \nand shall name Landlord and any other party designated by Landlord as additional insureds \non its commercial general liability insurance, and (v) in the event of any termination, re-\nentry or dispossess by Landlord under this lease, the subtenant shall, at Landlord’s option, \nvacate the Premises or attorn to Landlord pursuant to the then executory provisions of the \nsublease, except that Landlord shall  not  be  (a)  liable  for  any  previous  act  or  omission  of  \nTenant under the sublease, (b) subject to any offset not expressly provided in the sublease, \n(c )  be  required  to  pay  any  construction  allowance  or  other  monetary  payment  due  or\npayable from or by Tenant as sublandlord, or (d) bound by any change or extension of the\nsublease  or  prepayment  of  more  than  one  (1) month’s  rent  to  which  Landlord  did  not\nconsent in writing.\n(i)Any  Guarantor  delivers  to  Landlord  such  agreements  as  Landlord\nmay reasonably require confirming Guarantor’s continuing liability under its guaranty of \nthis lease,  but no failure to execute or deliver such documents shall impair such Guarantor’s \ncontinuing liability under such guaranty in accordance with the terms of such guaranty. \nSection 12.5 If this lease is assigned or the Premises are sublet, in whole \nor in part, Tenant shall remain liable for the performance of all of the terms, covenants and \nconditions  of  this  lease  on  the  part  of  Tenant  to  be  performed  or  observed  and  any  \nGuarantor  shall  continue  to  remain  liable  under  the  terms  of  its  guaranty  of  this  lease.  \nTenant’s  liability  hereunder  shall  not  be  affected  by  any  modification  of   this  lease  or  \nagreement made  between  Landlord  and  any  assignee  or  subtenant,  or  by  reason  of  any  \ndelay or failure on Landlord’s part to enforce any of its rights under this lease; provided \nthat if any such modification or agreement increases the obligation of the assignee under \nthis lease, the liability of the assignor-Tenant under this lease shall continue to be no greater \nthan if such modification or agreement had not been made unless such assignee is a person \n\n \n \n- 19 - \nor entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control \nwith Tenant. \nSection 12.6 The   consent   by   Landlord   to   any   assignment,   transfer,   \noccupancy,  encumbrance  or other transaction described in Section  12.1,  shall  not  in  any  \nway be deemed to relieve Tenant from obtaining the express consent of Landlord prior to \nany further such transaction or any proposed assignment, which consent may be granted or \ndenied at Landlord’s discretion.   \nSection 12.7 The   acceptance   by   Landlord   of   Rent   following   any   \nassignment, sublease, encumbrance, license, occupancy, or other transaction in violation \nof this Article, shall not be deemed a consent by Landlord to such transaction, nor a waiver \nof any right or remedy of Landlord hereunder. \nArticle 13. Access; Changes in Building and Real Property \nSection 13.1 Landlord reserves the right to (a) place (and have access to) \nconcealed ducts, pipes and conduits through the Premises (without a material reduction or \nreconfiguration  of  the  useable  area  of  the  Premises),  and  (b)  enter  the  Premises  at  \nreasonable times on reasonable prior notice, which may be oral (but prior notice shall not \nbe required in an emergency), to inspect the Premises, to show the Premises to others or to \nperform any work or make any improvement Landlord deems necessary or desirable to the \nPremises  or  the  Building  or  for  the  purpose  of  complying  with  Laws.    If  Tenant  is  not  \npresent when Landlord desires to enter the Premises, Landlord or Landlord’s contractors \nmay enter the Premises (by force, in the event of an emergency) without liability to Tenant. \nSection 13.2 If  there  is  to  be  any  excavation  or  construction  adjacent  to  \nthe Building, Tenant shall permit Landlord and/or any other person to enter the Premises \nto  perform  such  work  as  Landlord  or  that  person  deems  necessary  to  protect  the  Real \nProperty, without any abatement of the Rent or liability to Tenant. \nSection 13.3 Landlord shall have right to use all or any part of the roof of \nthe Building and to erect temporary scaffolds and other aids to construction on the exterior \nof  the  Premises  in  connect ion  with  alterations,  repairs,  improvements,  and/or  addit ions  \nLandlord  may  make  to  the  Building,   provided  that  access  to  the  Premises  shall  not  be  \ndenied.   \nSection 13.4 Landlord shall exercise Landlord’s rights under this Article \nin  a  manner  which  reasonably  minimizes  interference  with  the  conduct  of  Tenant’s  \nbusiness  in  the  Premises  and  damage  to  the  Premises,  Tenant’s  Work  and  Tenant’s  \nProperty (all of which shall promptly be repaired by Landlord, at its expense), but Landlord \nis not required to employ overtime labor or incur additional expenses. \n\n \n \n- 20 - \nArticle 14. Default \nSection 14.1 Each of the following (a “Default”) is a material default by \nTenant under this lease: \n(a) Tenant fails to pay when due any Rent and the failure continues for \nthree  (3)  days  following  Landlord’s  notice  (which  notice  shall  also  be  considered  any  \ndemand required by any Laws).  If, however, Landlord gives such a notice of failure to pay \nRent twice in any twelve (12) month period, any additional failure to pay any Rent when \ndue within that twelve (12) month period shall be considered a Default, requiring Landlord \nto serve,  by certified mail/return receipt requested,  a Notice of Default to Tenant advising \nTenant that Tenant has 14 days from receipt of said Notice of Default to cure the default \nwith the payment of the outstanding Rent. \n(b) Tenant    fails    to    comply    with    Art icle    15 or    makes    any    \nmisrepresentation under Section 20.1.       \n(c) Tenant  fails  to  comply  with  any  other  term  of  this  lease  and  the  \nfailure continues for thirty (30) days following Landlord’s notice.  If, however, compliance \ncannot, with diligence, reasonably be fully accomplished within that thirty (30) day period, \nTenant shall have an additional period not to exceed forty-five (45) days to fully comply, \nprovided Tenant notifies Landlord of its intention to comply (with reasonably detailed steps \nto be taken) and commences compliance within that thirty (30) day period and thereafter \npursues  compliance  to  completion  with  diligence  and  provides  Landlord  with  status  \nupdates on the progress at least every fifteen (15) days. \n(d) A third party institutes against Tenant, any legal action seeking any \nrelief  from  its  debts  under  any  applicable bankruptcy  or  insolvency  Laws  which  is  not  \ndismissed  wit hin  ninet y  (90)  days,  or  Tenant  or  Guarantor,  if  any,  institutes  any    legal  \naction seeking such relief, and/or a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official is \nappointed for Tenant or Guarantor, if any, or for all or a substantial portion of its assets, or \nTenant or Guarantor, if any, commits any other act indicating insolvency such as making \nan assignment for the benefit of its creditors. \n(e) Except  as  otherwise  expressly  permitted  under  this  lease,  Tenant \nvacates or abandons the Premises prior to the Expiration Date. \n(f) Tenant fails to comply with Rules and Food Use Rider, if applicable, \nmore than three (3) times in any Ocean Beach Park Season and upon written notice of same \nby Landlord. \nSection 14.2 If  a  Default  occurs,  this  lease  is  subject  to  the  conditional  \nlimitation that Landlord may,  at any time during the continuance of the Default,  give notice \nto Tenant that this lease shall terminate on the date specified in that notice, which date shall \nnot be less than  fourteen (14) days after Landlord gives such notice to Tenant.  If Landlord \ngives that notice, this lease and the Term shall expire and come to an end on the date set \n\n-\n21 -\nforth  in  that  notice  as  if  said  date  were  the  date  originally  fixed  in  this  lease  as  the  \nExpiration Date and Tenant shall quit and surrender the Premises to Landlord (but Tenant \nshall remain liable as provided in this lease). \nSection 14.3 If Tenant is in arrears in the payment of Rent, Tenant waives \nTenant’s right, if any, to designate the items against which any payments made by Tenant \nare  to  be  credited,  and  Landlord  may  apply  any  payments  made  by  Tenant  to  any  items  \nLandlord sees fit. \nArticle 15. Rem\nedies \nSection 15.1 If this lease is terminated pursuant to Article 14 or Landlord \nreenters or obtains possession of the Premises by summary proceedings or any other legal \naction or by force or otherwise (which Landlord may do without further notice and without \nliability or obligation to Tenant or any occupant of the Premises), all of the provisions of \nthis Section shall apply (in addition to any other applicable provisions of this lease). \n(a)Tenant,   and  all  other  occupants,   shall  vacate  and  surrender  to\nLandlord the Premises in accordance with this lease. \n(b)Landlord, at Landlord’s option, may (i) relet the Premises, or any\nportion of the Premises, from time to time, in the name of Landlord, Tenant or otherwise, \nas determined by Landlord, to any person and on any terms, but Landlord  shall  have  no  \nobligation to relet the Premises, or any portion of the Premises, or to collect any rent (and \nthe failure to relet the Premises, or any portion of the Premises, or to collect any rent shall \nnot  impose  any  liability  or  obligation  on  Landlord or relieve Tenant of any obligation or \nliability  under  this  lease),  and  (ii)  make  any  changes  to  the  Premises  as  Landlord,  in  \nLandlord’s  judgment,  considers  advisable  or  necessary  in  connection  with  a  reletting,  \nwithout  imposing  any  liability  or  obligation  on  Landlord  or  relieving  Tenant  of  any  \nobligation or liability under this lease. \n(c)Tenant shall pay Landlord all Rent payable to the date on which this\nlease is terminated or Landlord re-enters or obtains possession of the Premises. \n(d)Tenant  shall  also  pay  to  Landlord,  as  damages,  any  deficiency\nbetween (i) the aggregate Rent for the period which otherwise would have constituted the \nunexpired portion of the Term and (ii) the rents, if any, applicable to that period collected \nunder any reletting of all or any portion of the Premises.  Tenant shall pay any deficiency \nin    annual installments on the days specified in this lease for payment of installments of the \nFixed Rent, and Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant each annual deficiency \nas the same arises.  No suit to collect the deficiency for any year shall prejudice Landlord’s \nright to collect the deficiency for any subsequent year.  Tenant shall not be entitled to any \nrents  payable  (whether  or  not  collected)  under  any  reletting,  whether  or  not those rents \nexceed the Rent. If Landlord relets the Premises, or any portion of the Premises, together \nwith other space in the Building, the rents collected under the reletting and the expenses of \nthe reletting shall be equitably apportioned for the purposes of this Article.  \n\n- 22\n -\n(e)Landlord may recover from Tenant, and Tenant shall pay Landlord,\non  request,  in  lieu  of  any  further  deficiency  pursuant  to  the  preceding  paragraph  of  this  \nSection  (as  liquidated  damages  for  such  deficiency)  the  amount  by  which  (i)  the  unpaid  \nRent for the period which otherwise would have constituted the unexpired portion of the \nTerm (conclusively presuming the Addit io nal Rent for each year thereof to be the same as \nwas payable for the year immediately preceding the termination, re-entry or obtaining of \npossession)  exceeds  (ii)  the  then  fair  market  rental  value  of  the  Premises,  including  the  \nAddit io nal Rent for the same period, both discounted to present value at an annual rate of \ninterest equal to five (5%) percent.  If, before presentation of proof of liquidated damages, \nLandlord relets the Premises or any portion of the Premises for any period pursuant to a \nbona fide lease with an unrelated third party, the net rents (after deducting reletting costs) \npayable  in  connection  with  the  reletting  shall  be  considered  to  be  the  fair  market rental \nvalue for the Premises or the portion of the Premises relet during the term of the reletting.  \n(f)Tenant shall also pay Landlord, as additional damages, any expenses\nincurred  by  Landlord  in  connection  with  the  termination,  reentry  or  obtaining  of  \npossession, and the reletting of the Premises, including all repossession costs, brokerage \ncommissions,  reasonable  attorneys’  fees  and  disbursements,  alteration  costs  and  other  \nexpenses of preparing the Premises for reletting.   \n(g)Nothing  contained  in  this  lease  shall  be  considered  to  limit  or\npreclude  the  recovery  by  Landlord  from  Tenant  of  the  maximum  amount  allowed  to  be  \nobtained as damages or otherwise by any Laws. \nSection 15.2 Tenant  hereby  waives  (a)  the  service  of  any  notice  of  \nintention to re-enter or obtain possession of the Premises or to institute any legal action in \nconnection  therewith,  except  as  provided  in  this  lease  and  (b)  on  its  own  behalf  and  on  \nbehalf of all persons claiming under Tenant, including all creditors, any rights Tenant and \nall such persons might otherwise have under any Laws to redeem the Premises, to re-enter \nor repossess the Premises, or to restore this lease, after (i) Tenant is dispossessed pursuant \nto  any  Laws  or  by  any  Authority,  (ii)  Landlord  reenters  or  obtains  possession  of  the  \nPremises, or (iii) the Expiration Date, whether by operation of law or pursuant to this lease. \nThe  words  “re-enter,”  “re-entry”  and  “re-entered”  as  used  in  this  lease  shall  not  be  \nconsidered to be restricted to their technical legal meanings. Landlord shall have the right \nto enjoin any Default and the right to invoke any remedy allowed by any Laws in addition \nto any remedies provided in this lease.  All remedies provided in this lease are cumulative \nand  Landlord’s  right  to  invoke,  or  the invocation  of,  any  remedy  shall  not  preclude  \nLandlord from invoking any other remedy under this lease or under any and all Laws. \nSection 15.3 Landlord and Tenant each hereby waive trial by jury in any \nlegal  action  brought  by  either  party  against  the  other  in  connection  with  this  lease.  If  \nLandlord commences any summary proceeding against Tenant, Tenant shall not interpose \nany counterclaim in that proceeding (unless the failure to impose the counterclaim would \npreclude Tenant from asserting in a separate legal action the claim which is the subject of \nthe  counterclaim),  and  shall  not  seek  to  consolidate  the  proceeding  with  any  other  legal  \naction. \n\n- 23\n -\nSection 15.4 If  Tenant  fails  to  comply  with  any  of  its  obligations  under  \nthis  lease,  Landlord  may,  at  its  option,  cure  such breach  of  this  lease.    All  costs  and  \nexpenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred by Landlord in \nthat connection shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord as Additional Rent within fifteen (15) \ndays after Tenant is billed therefor.  \nSection 15.5  Tenant  shall  also  reimburse  Landlord  for  all  costs  and  \nexpenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements), incurred by Landlord \nin connection with a default by Tenant, including instituting, prosecuting and/or defending \nany legal action by or against Tenant whether a non-payment or holdover proceeding, or \nother proceeding, if Landlord prevails in such legal action, together with interest thereon \nat  the  Default  Rate  (hereinafter  defined).    Any  attorney’s  fees  shall  be  calculated  at  the  \nprevailing market hourly rate. \nSection 15.6 The failure of Landlord to seek redress for a Default, or of \nLandlord or Tenant to insist upon the strict performance of any term of this lease, shall not \nprevent  Landlord  from  redressing  a  subsequent  Default  or  Landlord  or  Tenant  from  \nthereafter  insisting  on  strict  performance.    The  receipt  by  Landlord  of  the  Rent  with  \nknowledge of a Default or Tenant’s failure to strictly perform under this lease shall not be \ndeemed a waiver of the Default or failure.  No term of this lease shall be considered waived \nby Landlord or Tenant unless the waiver is in a writing signed by the waiving party.  No \npayment  by  Tenant  or  receipt  by  Landlord  of  a  lesser  amount  than  the  Rent  shall  be  \nconsidered other than on account of the next installment of the Rent, or as Landlord may \nelect to apply same.  No endorsement or statement on any check or letter accompanying \nany  check  or  payment  shall  prevent  Landlord  from  cashing  the  check  or  otherwise  \naccepting the payment, without prejudice to Landlord’s right to recover the balance of the \nRent or pursue any other remedy. \nSection 15.7 If Tenant fails to pay any installment of the Fixed Rent or \nany Additional Rent within five (5) days after the due date thereof, in addition to any other \nright  or  remedy  of  Landlord,  Tenant  shall  pay  to  Landlord  within  fifteen  (15)  days  \nfo llo wing Landlord’s invoice (a) a late charge equal to the greater of one hundred ($100.00) \ndollars and four (4%) percent of the amount unpaid and (b) interest at the rate (the “Default  \nRate”)  of  twelve  (12%)  percent  per  annum  on  the  amount  unpaid,  from  the  date  the  \npayment was first due to and including the date paid and, (c) and Landlord’s bank charges \nfor the return of any Tenant’s check. \nSection 15.8 All legal actions relating to this lease shall be adjudicated in \nthe courts of the State of New York having jurisdiction in the county in which the Premises \nis located.  Tenant irrevocably consents to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of \nthose courts in any legal action relating to this lease or any guaranty of Tenant’s obligations \nunder this lease, and Tenant shall not assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, \nany  objection  to  any  such  court  being  the  venue  of  such  legal  action  or  claim  that  such  \nvenue is an inconvenient forum for Tenant or any principal of Tenant.   \n\n-\n24 -\nArticle 16. Notices; Consents and Approvals \nSection 16.1 Except as may be provided in this lease, all notices and other \ncommunications  under  this  lease  must  be  in  writing  and  sent  by  nationally  recognized  \novernight  courier  service  or  registered  or  certified  mail  (return  receipt  requested),  \naddressed to Landlord or Tenant at its Notice Address.  Either party may, by notice given \nin accordance with this Article, designate a different Notice Address, which address change \nshall become effective upon receipt, the date rejected or the date of attempted delivery (if \nthe receiving party is not present). \nSection 16.2 Any notice or other communication sent as provided in this \nArticle shall be effective (a) on the date received, the date rejected, or the date of attempted \ndelivery  (if  the  receiving party is not present) if sent by overnight courier service, or (b) \nthree (3) business days after mailing by registered or certified mail.   \nSection 16.3 If any provision of this lease requires Landlord’s consent or \napproval, such consent or approval shall be effective only if given in writing. \nSection 16.4 Any  notice  or  other  communication  given  by  Landlord  to  \nTenant  in  accordance  with  this  Article  may  be  signed  and  given  by  Landlord’s  attorney \nwith the same force and effect as if signed and given by Landlord. \nArticle 17.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAW  \nDuring the evaluation process, the content of \neach Bid will be held in confidence and details of \nany Bid will not be revealed (except as may be \nrequired under the Freedom of Information Law \nor other State law).  The Freedom of Information \nLaw provides for an exemption from disclosure \nfor trade secrets or information the disclosure of \nwhich would cause injury to the competitive \nposition of commercial enterprises.  This \nexception would be effective both during and \nafter the evaluation process.  If the Bid contains \nany such trade secret or other confidential or \nproprietary information, it must be accompanied \nin the Bid with a written request to the \nPurchasing Agent to not disclose such \ninformation.

Where a Freedom of \nInformation request is made for trademark or \nother confidential or proprietary information, the \nPurchasing Agent reserves the right to determine \nupon written notice to the Bidder whether such \ninformation qualifies for the exemption for \ndisclosure under the law.  Notwithstanding the \nabove, where a Bid tabulation is prepared and \nBids publicly opened, such Bid tabulation shall \nbe available upon request.  \n \n15.

We received 4 responses.  As a result, an Evaluation Committee was \nformed to review and evaluate the proposals.  The Committee then met to discuss and it \nascertained that two of the respondents exceeded the grant funds allocated for this \nproject.  Accordingly, they wanted to meet both respondents whose proposals were \nbelow such.   \n \nBetween yesterday and today, the Committee met with both for an oral presentation as \nto their proposals.  At the conclusion of the meetings, the Committee unanimously \nvoted to recommend an award to Desman Parking Specialists, 7900 E. Union Avenue, \nDenver, CO  80287 in the amount of $141,245.00, in that their proposal best meets the \nneeds of the City and fulfills the requirements of the New York State Empire State \nDevelopment Grant.  The project should be completed by early 2026. \n \nI have attached the RFP along Desman’s response for your convenience. \n \nPresent at the opening for the City of Long Beach were Lauren DeVito and myself. \n \nPlease advise. \n \nThank you! \n \nCc:  Steven Pambianchi, Assistant Corporation Counsel \n\n \n1 | P a g e \n \n \n \n \n \nCity of Long Beach \nPurchasing Department \nONE WEST CHESTER STREET \nLONG BEACH, NEW YORK 11561 \nTEL: (516) 431-1006 \nFAX:  (516) 431-1839 \n \n \nPURCHASING DEPARTMENT    JANUARY 10, 2025 \n \n \nRFP #2024-154 Parking Management Plan \n \nAddendum No. 1 \n \nPlease be advised that this solicitation has been extended and the return \ndate has been moved to February 6, 2025 at 11:00 a.m \n \n \nAdditionally, the City has received the following questions with regard to \nthe above Request for Proposal:  \n  \nQuestion No. 1:  \nThe RFP refers to the MWBE participation goal of 30% ($21,000) implying a study budget of \n$70,000. Your City budget shows additional funding sources for the Parking Study adding up to \n$300,000. Is that the project budget for this study? \n  \nResponse to Question No. 1:  \nThe maximum available budget for this project is $150,000 ($70,000 in NYS grant funding + \n$80,000 in City funding). Please be advised that the 30% MWBE goal referenced in Section C \n\n \n2 | P a g e \n \n(page 4) is not 30% of the TOTAL project budget, but is 30% of the grant-funded portion only. \nTo clarify - the MWBE goal for the TOTAL project will be 14%. For example, a total project cost \nof $150,000 would have an MWBE goal of $21,000, and a total project cost of $100,000 would \nhave an MWBE goal of $14,000. \n \nQuestion No. 2:  \nYou mention the requirement to undertake parking occupancy surveys and the substantial \nseasonal variation in the local population and parking demand. Do you expect the consultant to \nundertake parking occupancy counts during a typical non-peak season and during the peak \nsummertime season? \n  \nResponse to Question No. 2: \nYes, the City prefers that the consultant conduct the parking survey (Task 1B) during both peak \nand off-peak seasons (to the extent that both can be done within the proposed project schedule \nand project budget). This is also referenced in the RFP on page 4 (Section B. Background). \n\n \n1 | P a g e \n \n \n \n \n \nCity of Long Beach \nPurchasing Department \nONE WEST CHESTER STREET \nLONG BEACH, NEW YORK 11561 \nTEL: (516) 431-1006 \nFAX:  (516) 431-1839 \n \n \nPURCHASING DEPARTMENT    JANUARY 23, 2025 \n \n \nRFP #2024-154 Parking Management Plan \n \nAddendum No. 2 \n \nThe City has received the following additional questions with regard to \nthe above Request for Proposal:  \n  \nQuestion No. 1:  \nDoes the consultant need to perform occupancy counts on special events days during off-peak \nand peak season? The RFP asked to “analyze the impact of special events and activities on \nparking demand? \n  \nResponse to Question No. 1:  \nNo, the consultant does not need to conduct occupancy counts on special events days. But \nspecial event days will exacerbate parking demand further, so the issue should be considered and \nsolutions should be incorporated into the final parking management plan report. \n \nQuestion No. 2:  \nIn Task 1B, has the City collected historical data for comparison purposes? \n\n \n2 | P a g e \n \nResponse to Question No. 2:  \nWhile the City does not have historical data for the full study area, a draft parking management \nplan was prepared in 2022 and included parking counts and utilization rates for a discrete portion \nof Park Avenue. Draft materials including deliverables and City Council work session videos are \npublicly available here: https://www.longbeachny.gov/index.asp?SEC=95202AE4-BE3A-4567-\n84A6-F664E489CBCF. In addition, the 2023 Comprehensive Plan included a high level parking \nanalysis that identified general parking challenges throughout the city, and is available here: \nhttps://www.longbeachny.gov/vertical/sites/%7BC3C1054A-3D3A-41B3-8896-\n814D00B86D2A%7D/uploads/Long_Beach_Comp_Plan__FULL.pdf  \n \nQuestion No. 3:  \nIn Task 1C, does the City maintain a list of registered parking facilities or properties that contain \naccessory parking? If so, will the list be available to the selected consultant? \n \nResponse to Question No. 3:  \nYes, a list of registered parking assets will be provided to the selected consultant. \n \nQuestion No. 4:  \nIn Task 1C, in addition to the criteria set by the selected consultant, does the city have preferred \nrequirements to identify areas to expand or redevelop parking facilities and can they be provided \nat this time? \n \nResponse to Question No. 4:  \nNo, not at this time. \n \nQuestion No. 5:  \nIn Task 1C, besides \"median parking,\" does the inventory need to include all actual on-street \nparking, and if so, the corresponding parking regulations for every on-street parking space? \n \nResponse to Question No. 5:  \nYes, the inventory should include on-street parking spaces and their corresponding parking \nregulations. \n \n\n \n3 | P a g e \n \n \nQuestion No. 6:  \nIs the information summarized as part of the Task 1A code review expected to be included as \npart of the Shape File deliverable? \n \nResponse to Question No. 6:  \nYes, although the City is open to consider alternative forms of digitizing this information. \n \nQuestion No. 7:  \nIn Task 2C, will we be able to request similar studies (as necessary) from other municipalities, \non behalf of the City of Long Beach? \n \nResponse to Question No. 7:  \nYes \n \nQuestion No. 8:  \nIn Task 3, will the City require detailed specifications sheets of the proposed parking signage to \nbe used for manufacturing? \n \nResponse to Question No. 8:  \nDetailed sign specification sheets are not required; however, illustrative sign examples should be \nprovided at a minimum if the city decides to have the signs manufactured. \n \nQuestion No. 9:  \nTask 6 from the scope of service is not included in the Price Proposal Form table. Should it be \ninserted as an additional item in the table as part of the final bid? \n \nResponse to Question No. 8:  \nYes, the Price Schedule on page 13 is missing a row for Task 6, which should have been \nincluded.

The consultant \nwill facilitate meetings with stakeholders and members of the community and present the plan and \nrecommendations to the Long Beach City Council. \nB.BACKGROUND:\nThe City of Long Beach is a suburban community/visitor destination (especially in the summer) with 3.5 miles \nof pristine beaches, an iconic boardwalk, as well as high quality restaurants, shops, and a multi-modal \ntransportation center with regional connections. However, being a regional destination located on a narrow \nbarrier island with a higher population density (15,665 persons per square mile) than most of Long Island \nresults in daily and seasonal parking challenges. \nLong Beach’s success has created its own set of problems, in terms of parking supply not meeting the demands \nof the City. A common sentiment based upon community engagement surveys is that existing parking is \ninsufficient to meet the demands for residents, businesses, and visitors. The lack of parking hinders access to \nlocal businesses, resulting in revenue losses for the City and business community. On-street and off-street \nparking makes up just 0.8 percent of the total land area and the demand for parking surges in the summer when \nthe City’s year-round population of approximately 35,000 can balloon to over 60,000. This increase is primarily \ndue to visitors that are attracted to the beach and other recreational resources, many of whom arrive by car. In \naddition, a significant proportion of high-rise buildings provide less on-site parking than would otherwise be \nrequired by the existing zoning requirements, resulting in increased competition for parking throughout the \nCity. Additional congestion also comes from Park Avenue being used as the primary east-west thoroughfare \nbetween Lido Beach to the east and Atlantic Beach to the west. Park Avenue expands to a maximum width of \napproximately 155 feet (not including sidewalks) and consists of six travel lanes (three in each direction), two \nparking lanes, and an approximately 60-foot wide parking median. This has attracted drivers to Long Beach \nwho use this corridor to pass through to other destinations, as demonstrated by high Annual Average Daily \nTraffic (AADT) and Design Hour Volume (DHV) rates collected by New York State Department of \nTransportation. There is additional road pressure in the West End where the roadway system narrows to one \nlane in each direction on Beech Street. \nThese factors add to the complexity of parking in the City and the concern that future economic growth is \nstymied by parking infrastructure not meeting existing demand.  Parking and curb usage play an important role \nin the overall transportation system. On-street parking is the primary form of parking supply in Long Beach. \nHowever, there is also a significant amount of off-street parking resources including municipal surface lots and \na garage. An inadequate parking supply, combined with strong demand, leads to unnecessary circulation as \nmotorists search for parking spaces and/or park illegally, thus reducing roadway capacity. The existing parking \n\nCity of Long Beach      Parking Management Plan \nPurchasing Department Page 4 \nresources along, but not limited to, the major commercial corridors and beach-oriented destinations throughout \nthe City are not sufficiently managed. The negative consequences that result from the misalignment between \nparking supply and demand affect the broade  r community and the economy.  \nTherefore, the City seeks the professional services of a consultant to develop a comprehensive parking \nmanagement plan that analyzes parking solutions for the City in a cost-efficient and self-sustaining manner that \nreconciles the needs of residents, visitors, and local businesses. The assessment should pay particular focus on \nthe three major downtown commercial corridors: the West End (Beech Street), Central Park Avenue, and the \nEast End (East Park Avenue), but should also consider how parking in these corridors impacts the surrounding \nareas, and vice versa. See Attachment B \nfor a map of the three downtown corridors. \nA thorough parking analysis should address the City’s existing on- and off-street parking resources, where \ndemand far exceeds supply, while balancing the needs of residents, businesses, and visitors. The primary \nobjective of this study is to identify practical strategies that can be adopted to increase efficiency and utilization \nof exiting parking resources, particularly during peak summer months when demand significantly exceeds \nsupply. The analysis should include a parking survey to document capacity, utilization (number of parked \nvehicles and type), parking regulations on each block frontage and off-street parking facilities for peak and off-\npeak periods. Observations of illegal parking should also be included. The need for short, medium, and long-\nterm parking for all users should be addressed. The parking analysis should focus on the aforementioned three \nmajor downtowns areas during weekday and weekend peak periods.  However, given the seasonal parking \ndemands of the City and \nto most accurately ascertain parking needs, collection of existing conditions should \noccur during the early summer when parking demand is strongest and most competitive. Recommendations \nshould consider the inclusion of metered parking, \nin a way that respects the parking needs of residents. As the \nCity is on a barrier island that has flooding, resiliency measures that address parking issues are important as \nwell. Aesthetic techniques to optimize parking should also be considered (i.e. via landscape design, signage, \nand other aesthetic means).  \nThe objective of this proposed parking management study is consistent with the City of Long Beach 2022-2032 \nComprehensive Plan that was adopted on August 1, 2023. The Comprehensive Plan included several parking-\nrelated strategies in the Implementation Action Plan including the design and implementation of a parking \nmanagement plan, the redesign of existing parking facilities, the development of more transit-oriented \ndevelopment, and the evaluation of transportation demand strategies.

These records range in years from the 1950’s to \nthe early 2000’s. Many of these records are old and in poor condition. \n \nImportant Note: Seery Systems staff will need to take all the Permanent Record Files stored in the 287 \ntransfile size boxes and re-box them into 574 of our standard archive boxes (15” x 12” x 10”).  \nWe surveyed the Permanent Record Files, and we estimate the following volume of work: \n \nPermanent Record Files include: \n (574) Archive Boxes of Files \n 1,100,000 Business Documents  \n 54,250 Large Format Plans  \n 10,000 Photos \n Index each file by the type of record it is, for example, Comptrollers Payroll Reports and then the \nname on each file folder. \n \nThe above documents include the following department’s’ records: \n- Comptroller Records (Payroll and Fixed Asset) \n- Community Development  \n- Department of Public Works \n- Civil Service \n- Building Department \n- Corporate Counsel \n \nThe above files will be indexed by either two (2) or three (3) fields depending on the type of record they are. \n \nTo provide for secure backup and to facilitate authorized access to these records without degrading the \noriginals due to handling the City of Long Beach Building Department recognizes the need for a digital \nconversion. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n  \n \n \nConversion Procedures for Scanning Permanents Records  \n \n Seery Systems will provide the boxes and repack the records into new boxes that are stored at the \nCity of Long Beach Maple facility. \n Seery Systems will transport the boxes to our facility in Garden City Park.  \n Seery Systems will create an inventory list of all files in each box and provide the list to the City. \n Seery Systems will index each file. All this information will be found on the front of each file folder. \n Seery Systems will create a Barcode Separator Cover Sheet for each file. If there is a Large Format Plan \nin the file Seery Systems will create another Barcode Separator Cover Sheet. \n Seery Systems will prepare the documents for scanning which includes pulling all staples, paperclips, \ntaping torn documents and unfolding documents so they are flat and ready to be scanned. These files will \nrequire quite a bit of preparation. Many of these documents are old and in poor condition. Some were \neven water damaged and will be remediated. The Large Format Maps are presently all folded within each \nfolder and need to be unfolded and laid flat for a while before scanning. There are also Roll Plans that are \nrolled up and need to be laid flat before scanning.  \n Seery Systems will scan the regular business documents from 8.5”x11” up to 11”x14” on a standard \ndocument scanner while the Large Format Plans (B thru E size) up to 34” x44” will be scanned on a \nLarge Format Engineering Scanner. \n If any of the files contain both regular size documents and Large Format Plans after both sets of \ndocuments (regular size and plans) are scanned, they will be merged back together and delivered \nback as one digital file.  \n Seery Systems will scan all documents at 300 DPI and provide the best possible image for each page. \n Upon completion of the scanning process, a final quality control check will be performed. All images \nwill be reviewed for image quality.  Any problems discovered with image quality will be corrected \nother than those affected by the quality of the original document. \n Seery Systems will create PDF files of the original TIFF files. \n Seery Systems will create a format for Images and Indexes to meet the specifications of your \nLaserfiche Document Management system. \n Seery Systems will output and deliver the images back on a hard drive. \n Seery Systems will then deliver all images, indexes, and hard drive to the City of Long Beach for \nuploading into your Laserfiche Document Management System.  \n Once the project is completed and we have delivered the digital files back to the City of Long Beach, we \nwould ask you review the files and then give us written approval to shred your boxes. We usually ask \nthat you can give us approval within thirty (30) days. Seery Systems will email you a Notice of \nDestruction document which we would ask you to sign so we can move forward with shredding your \nboxes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n  \n \n \nSection II - Document Conversion Costs \n \nImportant Note: The above volume of work is very difficult to estimate because they are Building \nDepartment Property Files which contain both standard size business documents as well as many different \nsize Large Format Plans. Depending on the size of a plan they can be folded up multiple times and could take \nup the space of 8, 16 or 32 regular size documents based on how large the plan is and how many times the \nplan is folded.  \n \nThe above volume of work to be scanned is only an ESTIMATE.

For more than 138 years, H&H has \ndeveloped innovative engineering solutions for complex infrastructure projects with multiple challenges. \nH&H has been providing engineering services in Nassau County since 1934, with the design and \nconstruction management of several Jones Beach Parkway Bridges, critical elements of Long Island’s\ninfrastructure. Over the years, H&H has played a major role in the design and construction of the \ntransportation network in Nassau and Suffolk Counties and is familiar with and known to the region’s \ntransportation and public works agencies, consultant community, stakeholders, and politicians. H&H has \nworked on a wide variety of planning, design, and construction inspection projectsfor Nassau and \nSuffolk County DPWs, NYSDOT, NYCDOT, NYC Dept. of Design & Construction, MTA Bridges & Tunnels,\nand NYS Thruway. \nH&H’s Long Island office is conveniently located to the City of Long Beach.It serves as the office \nheadquarters for all our Long Island projects. This will permit our engineering professionals to meet and \ncollaborate with the City’s staff and access the project site to perform beneficial field reconnaissance prior \nto performing the construction inspection services. This will create efficiencies and help ensure time savings, \nthereby meeting the project schedule and budget.\nThis staff is very familiar with the City of Long Beach, as we are currently performing design services for \nthe major reconstruction of the Long Beach Bridge, a multi-discipline effort involving many members of our \nengineering staff. \nFor more details about the H&H Team’s relevant experience, please see the project \nprofiles at the end of this section. Also, we invite you to check our references found in \nSection v. of the proposal.  \n\n \n \n \n \nSection ii – Page 2 \n \n \nTHE H&H PLANNING GROUP \nH&H’s Community Planning Group assists villages, towns, and cities envision and prepare for the \nfuture and identify the policies, programs, and infrastructure investments that will lead them on a \nprosperous and successful path forward.\n \nComprehensive Plans \nOur work takes on a variety of forms, from leading a community visioning process and drafting a\ncomprehensive plan to formulating downtown revitalization strategies and advising a planning \nboard on zoning matters. We look for new and creative ways to approach our projects and tailor\nthe process and product to the place.\nResponding to the challenges facing communities today requires strategizing across discipline\nand departmental boundaries and understanding a community’s unique needs, strengths, and \npriorities. We undertake substantive online and in-person public engagement that involves \nmunicipal boards and committees, connects with local organizations and institutions, and inspires \nparticipation from residents of all walks of life.  \n \nWe provide realistic implementation guidance for plans by prioritizing initiatives and dividing the\nmost ambitious ones into smaller action items to be accomplished over time.\n \nTechnical Skills \nOur staff has a variety of skills that amplify the effectiveness of our core services. \nArchitectural & Environmental Graphics\n Cartography & GIS \n Graphic & Web Design \n Social Media Management\n \nClients \nOur clients are typically small and medium-sized communities in the Northeast across the rural to urban \nspectrum. \n Municipalities, County and State Agencies, Port Authorities \n Metropolitan Planning Organizations, Councils of Government \n Community Development Corporations and Special Services Districts \n Real Estate Development Entities \n \nCore Services \n Comprehensive Plans \nCommunity Visioning & Public Engagement\n Plans for Places - Downtowns, Corridors, & Neighborhoods \n Mobility & Transportation Plans \n Town & Village Planning Board Consulting \n Zoning Codes & Design Guidelines \n Environmental Assessments & Impact Statements\n \nDetailed resumes of key planning staff are attached at the end of this section. \n\n \n \n \n \nSection ii – Page 3 \n \n \nAPPROACH/SCOPE OF WORK \nNYS State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) \nBesides requiring conformance to Section 7-738 of the NYS Village Law, as well as the Town’s \ndevelopment and subdivision regulations, most development would be subject to the New York State \nEnvironmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA). H&H is intimately familiar with the SEQRA process, having \nworked with it extensively over the last 4-1/2 decades, reviewing thousands of environmental assessments \nand environmental impact statements on projects ranging from two-lot subdivisions to the SEQRA review of \nNassau Coliseum project on Long Island.\nIntended Approach to SEQRA Review \nScoping\nAs per the SEQRA regulations, it is the Applicant’s responsibility to prepare the first draft of the Scoping \nOutline. H&H will review that document and will work with the Town to revise it appropriately.\nH&H will participate in a public scoping session and, as a result of the input received at the scoping \nsession, H&H will prepare a final Scoping Outline for the Lead Agency to adopt. The Scoping Outline will \nrequire the analysis of the cumulative effect of the subject project along with any other proposed and \napproved projects in the area. \n \nPreliminary DEIS Review \nH&H will perform a “completeness” review of the initially submitted DEIS in relation to the approved \nScoping Outline. We will review this DEIS in terms of its scope, content, and adequacy in accordance with \nthe SEQRA regulations. H&H will prepare a memorandum to the Town outlining any deficiencies in the \nApplicant’s proposed DEIS, including gaps in information, obsolete or inaccurate data, the inadequate \nanalysis of alternatives, etc. \n \nDEIS Reviews\nH&H will review revised versions of the proposed DEIS which are submitted by the Applicant in response \nto comments which the Applicant has received regarding the initially submitted DEIS. We will also prepare \nmemoranda regarding the “completeness” of the revised versions of the DEIS.\n \nH&H will also perform a substantive review of the accepted DEIS once such a document has been found to \nbe adequate with respect to its scope and content for the purpose of commencing public review.\n \nDEIS Public Hearing\nH&H will attend and assist with the conducting of a public hearing on the DEIS. H&H will gather all the \nsubstantive comments received regarding the DEIS for the Applicant’s use in preparing the draft version of \nthe Final Environmental Impact Statement.\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \nSection ii – Page 4 \n \n \nFEIS Review \nH&H will review the Applicant’s initially submitted FEIS and will prepare a memorandum which outlines \nany deficiencies in that document. The FEIS is the Lead Agency’s document and the Lead Agency is \nresponsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the FEIS regardless of who prepares it. \nH&H will review all revised versions of the FEIS. We will prepare memoranda regarding the \n“completeness” of the revised FEIS and will attend a public board meeting regarding this matter. H&H will \nassist the Lead Agency in arriving at a document which contains all the substantive comments received \nregarding the DEIS and the Lead Agency’s responses to those comments. \nPreparation of a SEQRA Findings Statement \nH&H will prepare a draft environmental Findings Statement followed by a final Findings Statement for the \nTown’s use in concluding the SEQRA process. \n \nReview of Applications \nH&H will concentrate not only on the environmental issues involved, but also on the review of the \nannexation, rezoning petition, subdivision and site development plan application materials submitted by \nthe Applicant. We will review these application materials in the context of the Town’s land use regulations. \nThis is precisely the kind of land use application review work which H&H has performed for its numerous \nclient communities during its many decades of existence. We also recognize that review of the Traffic \nImpact Study is of great importance to the Town.\n \nOur overall capabilities in performing traffic reviews are detailed below. \n \nTraffic Review \nDevelopment Application Review\nH&H will provide review and comments on plans and traffic reports for the proposed development project \nto ensure compliance with current policy and standards, as well as on traffic impact analysis and traffic \nrelated studies, along with traffic signal, striping and road/driveway/intersection plans. Having served as \non-call traffic consultants for numerous municipalities, the firm has performed peer traffic and parking \nreviews on countless projects. \n \nDevelopment Application Assessment\nH&H has extensive experience conducting various types of traffic assessments and has been involved in \nevaluating, modeling, simulating, optimizing, and designing context-sensitive solutions under all phases of \ntransportation and development projects. We have a broad understanding of the transportation analysis \nprocess (including SEQRA/FHWA), the evaluation methodologies (including HCM, Synchro, MUTCD, \nAASHTO, etc.) and the technical expertise to conduct both the macroscopic and microscopic traffic \nanalyses for our clients. Depending upon traffic task orders assigned, H&H anticipates conducting some of \nthe following traffic analyses under this task: \n \n\n \n \n \n \nSection ii – Page 5 \n \n \nTraffic Data Collection – H&H is well qualified to plan and document data collection efforts, ranging from \nsimple traffic studies to highly complex transportation planning and design projects. H&H team members \nare fully aware of the accepted data collection formats, guidelines, and the types of data that are \nneeded in their respective areas of expertise. We understand the requirements that need to be followed \n(e.g., traffic data collected for SEQRA purposes, NYSDOT guidelines, and FHWA 13-type vehicle \nclassification). Our experience, coupled with our extensive knowledge of roadways and traffic conditions, \nwill allow us to proceed in an efficient manner for projects under this contract. H&H utilizes a number of \ntraffic counting firms to perform the actual traffic counts. These firms use a variety of data collection \ntechniques, from traditional traffic counts utilizing manual counting efforts to the latest Miovision Video \nCollection Units (VCU). In addition to these data collection techniques, H&H is also familiar with the traffic \ndata provided on NYSDOT’s Traffic Data Viewer website. \n \nTraffic Data Reduction Analysis – The data reduction helps in determining the peak traffic hour volumes, \nbalancing of the traffic network, and determining the AADT/AWDT, ADT’s, 30th highest hour volumes, \nPHF, vehicle classification, 85th percentile and average speed, delays, dwell time, census tract \ninformation, journey-to-work data and various other information needed for further macroscopic and \nmicroscopic traffic assessments. Our team has developed various systems to manage data, including taking \nadvantage of commercially available software systems such as database software systems.\nTraffic Safety Analysis – H&H includes professionals with extensive experience in traffic safety analysis in \nthe tri-state region. We have performed several projects to improve traffic safety by reducing vehicular-\npedestrian/bicyclist conflicts. Not only are we familiar with the technical requirements of a safety study, \nwe also build upon established professional practices and are very successful in developing feasible \naccident countermeasures. \n \nFour-Step Planning Analysis – Accurate and realistic estimates of future travel demand are critical \nelements of any transportation planning/traffic engineering project. H&H fully understands the various \nelements associated with travel demand forecasting, i.e.; from studies involving the general four-step \ntransportation planning approach (trip generation, trip distribution, modal split, and trip assignment) to \nstudies involving localized trip generation and other unique planning techniques. In addition, team\nmembers have significant experience in utilizing the latest ITE Trip Generation Handbook, the Parking \nGeneration Handbook, the SEQRA guidelines, the NYMTC data and trip generation surveys.\n \nTraffic Operational/Design Analyses – H&H is highly experienced in all aspects of traffic-related \nanalysis, including level of service analysis for highways, arterials, and intersections; pedestrian analysis; \nand roadway and toll plaza operations queuing analysis. Alternatives analysis, cost-benefit analysis, \nranking/prioritization of roadway, safety improvement options, and air quality/noise analysis were \nincluded in many of the projects that we have completed, particularly Environmental Impact Statements \n(EISs), Major Improvement Studies, Site Impact Analysis, and Safety Improvement Studies. \n \n \n\nSection ii – Page 6 \nH&H maintains the latest versions of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) and associated software. In \naddition, our team possesses various traffic engineering software including, but Synchro/SimTraffic. We \nhave conducted numerous signal warrant assessments utilizing the MUTCD and NYSDOT supplements. Over \nthe past five years, our traffic team has conducted hundreds of intersection capacity assessments for \nvarious municipalities, agencies, and private clients under different operating scenarios. \n\nFinal Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for Strongs \nMarina \n-\n-\n\nSITE PLAN & SEQRA Review for Continuing Care Community \n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nSEQRA Review for A/V Production

If additional work is required, or if you \nuse or request additional services, we will provide you with an addendum or change order, as \napplicable, outlining the costs for the additional work.  The price quotes in the addendum or change \norder will be valid for thirty (30) days from the date of the quote. \n \n4. Cancellation.

We will make all reasonable efforts to reassign personnel in the event you \ncancel within two (2) weeks of scheduled commitments. \n \n5. Services Warranty.  We will perform the services in a professional, workmanlike manner, consistent \nwith industry standards.  In the event we provide services that do not conform to this warranty, we \nwill re-perform such services at no additional cost to you. \n \n6. Site Access and Requirements.  At no cost to us, you agree to provide us with full and free access to \nyour personnel, facilities, and equipment as may be reasonably necessary for us to provide \nimplementation services, subject to any reasonable security protocols or other written policies \nprovided to us as of the Effective Date, and thereafter as mutually agreed to by you and us.   \n \n\n \n   \n6 \n7. Background Checks. For at least the past twelve (12) years, all of our employees have undergone \ncriminal background checks prior to hire. All employees sign our confidentiality agreement and \nsecurity policies. \n \n8. Client Assistance.  You acknowledge that the implementation of the Tyler Software is a cooperative \nprocess requiring the time and resources of your personnel.  You agree to use all reasonable efforts \nto cooperate with and assist us as may be reasonably required to meet the agreed upon project \ndeadlines and other milestones for implementation.  This cooperation includes at least working with \nus to schedule the implementation-related services outlined in this Agreement.  We will not be \nliable for failure to meet any deadlines and milestones when such failure is due to Force Majeure or \nto the failure by your personnel to provide such cooperation and assistance (either through action \nor omission). \n \n9. Maintenance and Support.  For so long as you timely pay your SaaS Fees according to the Invoicing \nand Payment Policy, then in addition to the terms set forth in the SLA and the Support Call Process, \nwe will: \n \n9.1 perform our maintenance and support obligations in a professional, good, and workmanlike \nmanner, consistent with industry standards, to resolve Defects in the Tyler Software (subject to \nany applicable release life cycle policy);  \n \n9.2 provide support during our established support hours; \n \n9.3 maintain personnel that are sufficiently trained to be familiar with the Tyler Software and Third \nParty Software, if any, in order to provide maintenance and support services; \n \n9.4 make available to you all releases to the Tyler Software (including updates and enhancements) \nthat we make generally available without additional charge to customers who have a \nmaintenance and support agreement in effect; and \n \n9.5 provide non-Defect resolution support of prior releases of the Tyler Software in accordance with \nany applicable release life cycle policy. \n \nWe will use all reasonable efforts to perform support services remotely.  Currently, we use a third-party \nsecure unattended connectivity tool called Bomgar, as well as GotoAssist by Citrix.  Therefore, you agree \nto maintain a high-speed internet connection capable of connecting us to your PCs and server(s).  You \nagree to provide us with a login account and local administrative privileges as we may reasonably \nrequire to perform remote services.  We will, at our option, use the secure connection to assist with \nproper diagnosis and resolution, subject to any reasonably applicable security protocols.  If we cannot \nresolve a support issue remotely, we may be required to provide onsite services.  In such event, we will \nbe responsible for our travel expenses, unless it is determined that the reason onsite support was \nrequired was a reason outside our control.  Either way, you agree to provide us with full and free access \nto the Tyler Software, working space, adequate facilities within a reasonable distance from the \nequipment, and use of machines, attachments, features, or other equipment reasonably necessary for \nus to provide the maintenance and support services, all at no charge to us.  We strongly recommend \nthat you also maintain your VPN for backup connectivity purposes. \n \n\n \n   \n7 \nFor the avoidance of doubt, SaaS Fees do not include the following services: (a) onsite support (unless \nTyler cannot remotely correct a Defect in the Tyler Software, as set forth above); (b) application design; \n(c) other consulting services; or (d) support outside our normal business hours as listed in our then-\ncurrent Support Call Process.

We will work with you as may be necessary to develop an action plan that \noutlines reasonable steps to be taken by each of us to resolve any issues presented in your notice.  \nYou may withhold payment of the amount(s) actually in dispute, and only those amounts, until we \ncomplete the action items outlined in the plan.  If we are unable to complete the action items \n\n \n   \n8 \noutlined in the action plan because of your failure to complete the items agreed to be done by you, \nthen you will remit full payment of the invoice.  We reserve the right to suspend delivery of all SaaS \nServices, including maintenance and support services, if you fail to pay an invoice not disputed as \ndescribed above within fifteen (15) days of notice of our intent to do so. \n \nSECTION F – TERM AND TERMINATION \n \n1.

Air Travel  \n  \nA. Reservations & Tickets  \n  \nThe Travel Management Company (TMC) used by Tyler will provide an employee with a direct \nflight within two hours before or after the requested departure time, assuming that flight does \nnot add more than three hours to the employee’s total trip duration and the fare is within $100 \n(each way) of the lowest logical fare.  If a net savings of $200 or more (each way) is possible \nthrough a connecting flight that is within two hours before or after the requested departure \ntime and that does not add more than three hours to the employee’s total trip duration, the \nconnecting flight should be accepted.    \n  \nEmployees are encouraged to make advanced reservations to take full advantage of discount \nopportunities.  Employees should use all reasonable efforts to make travel arrangements at \nleast two (2) weeks in advance of commitments.  A seven (7) day advance booking requirement \nis mandatory.  When booking less than seven (7) days in advance, management approval will be \nrequired.    \n  \nExcept in the case of international travel where a segment of continuous air travel is six (6) or \nmore consecutive hours in length, only economy or coach class seating is reimbursable. \nEmployees shall not be reimbursed for “Basic Economy Fares” because these fares are non-\nrefundable and have many restrictions that outweigh the cost-savings. \n  \nB.

Rental Car  \nEmployees are authorized to rent cars only in conjunction with air travel when cost, \nconvenience, and the specific situation reasonably require their use.  When renting a car for \nTyler business, employees should select a “mid-size” or “intermediate” car.  “Full” size cars may \nbe rented when three or more employees are traveling together.  Tyler carries leased vehicle \ncoverage for business car rentals; except for employees traveling to Alaska and internationally \n(excluding Canada), additional insurance on the rental agreement should be declined.  \n \nC.

Park and fly options located near some airports may also be used.  \nFor extended trips that would result in excessive parking charges, public transportation to/from \nthe airport should be considered.  Tolls will be reimbursed when receipts are presented.  \n  \n3. Lodging  \n  \nTyler’s TMC will select hotel chains that are well established, reasonable in price, and \nconveniently located in relation to the traveler's work assignment.  Typical hotel chains include \nCourtyard, Fairfield Inn, Hampton Inn, and Holiday Inn Express.  If the employee has a discount \nrate with a local hotel, the hotel reservation should note that discount and the employee should \nconfirm the lower rate with the hotel upon arrival.  Employee memberships in travel clubs such \nas AAA should be noted in their travel profiles so that the employee can take advantage of any \nlower club rates.   \n  \n“No shows” or cancellation fees are not reimbursable if the employee does not comply with the \nhotel’s cancellation policy.  \n  \n\nExhibit B \nSchedule 1 \n \n 3 \nTips for maids and other hotel staff are included in the per diem rate and are not reimbursed \nseparately.  \n \nEmployees are not authorized to reserve non-traditional short-term lodging, such as Airbnb, \nVRBO, and HomeAway. Employees who elect to make such reservations shall not be \nreimbursed. \n  \n4. Meals and Incidental Expenses  \n  \nEmployee meals and incidental expenses while on travel status within the continental U.S. are in \naccordance with the federal per diem rates published by the General Services Administration.  \nIncidental expenses include tips to maids, hotel staff, and shuttle drivers and other minor travel \nexpenses.  Per diem rates are available at www.gsa.gov/perdiem.    \n \nPer diem for Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. protectorates and international destinations are provided \nseparately by the Department of State and will be determined as required.  \n \nA.

Our Responsibilities \nWhen our support team receives a call from you that Downtime has occurred or is occurring, we will work \nwith you to identify the cause of the Downtime (including whether it may be the result of Planned \nDowntime, a Client Error Incident, denial of service attack or Force Majeure).  We will also work with you \nto resume normal operations. \nc.    Client Relief \nOur targeted Attainment Goal is 100%.

However, if Tyler anticipates that \nactivities during a Standard or Emergency Maintenance window may make the Tyler Software unavailable, \nwe will provide advance notice, as reasonably practicable, that the Tyler Software will be unavailable \nduring the maintenance window.  \n\nExhibit C \n \n 1 \n \n \nExhibit C \nSchedule 1 \nSupport Call Process  \n \nSupport Channels \n \nTyler Technologies, Inc. provides the following channels of software support for authorized users*:   \n(1) On-line submission (portal) – for less urgent and functionality-based questions, users may create \nsupport incidents through the Tyler Customer Portal available at the Tyler Technologies website.  \nA built-in Answer Panel provides users with resolutions to most “how-to” and configuration-\nbased questions through a simplified search interface with machine learning, potentially \neliminating the need to submit the support case.  \n(2) Email – for less urgent situations, users may submit emails directly to the software support \ngroup. \n(3) Telephone – for urgent or complex questions, users receive toll-free, telephone software \nsupport.  \n* Channel availability may be limited for certain applications. \nSupport Resources \n \nA number of additional resources are available to provide a comprehensive and complete support \nexperience:  \n(1) Tyler Website – www.tylertech.com – for accessing client tools, documentation, and other \ninformation including support contact information.  \n(2) Tyler Search -a knowledge based search engine that lets you search multiple sources \nsimultaneously to find the answers you need, 24x7.  \n(3) Tyler Community –provides a venue for all Tyler clients with current maintenance agreements to \ncollaborate with one another, share best practices and resources, and access documentation.  \n(4) Tyler University – online training courses on Tyler products. \nSupport Availability \n \nTyler Technologies support is available during the local business hours of 8 AM to 5 PM (Monday – \nFriday) across four US time zones (Pacific, Mountain, Central and Eastern). Tyler’s holiday schedule is \noutlined below. There will be no support coverage on these days.  \n \nNew Year’s Day Labor Day \nMartin Luther King, Jr. Day Thanksgiving Day \nMemorial Day Day after Thanksgiving \nIndependence Day Christmas Day \n \n\nExhibit C \n \n 2 \nFor support teams that provide after-hours service, we will provide you with procedures for contacting \nsupport staff after normal business hours for reporting Priority Level 1 Defects only. Upon receipt of \nsuch a Defect notification, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the resolution targets \nset forth below.  \n \nWe will also make commercially reasonable efforts to be available for one pre-scheduled Saturday of \neach month to assist your IT staff with applying patches and release upgrades, as well as consulting with \nthem on server maintenance and configuration of the Tyler Software environment. \n \nIncident Handling \n \nIncident Tracking \n \nEvery support incident is logged into Tyler’s Customer Relationship Management System and given a \nunique case number. This system tracks the history of each incident. The case number is used to track \nand reference open issues when clients contact support. Clients may track incidents, using the case \nnumber, through Tyler’s Customer Portal or by calling software support directly.  \n \nIncident Priority \n \nEach incident is assigned a priority level, which corresponds to the Client’s needs. Tyler and the Client \nwill reasonably set the priority of the incident per the chart below. This chart is not intended to address \nevery type of support incident, and certain “characteristics” may or may not apply depending on \nwhether the Tyler software has been deployed on customer infrastructure or the Tyler cloud. The goal is \nto help guide the Client towards clearly understanding and communicating the importance of the issue \nand to describe generally expected response and resolution targets in the production environment only. \n \nReferences to a “confirmed support incident” mean that Tyler and the Client have successfully validated \nthe reported Defect/support incident.   \n \nPriority \nLevel \nCharacteristics of Support Incident Resolution Targets\n*\n \n1 \nCritical \nSupport incident that causes (a) \ncomplete application failure or \napplication unavailability; (b) \napplication failure or unavailability in \none or more of the client’s remote \nlocation; or (c) systemic loss of \nmultiple essential system functions. \nTyler shall provide an initial response to Priority Level \n1 incidents within one (1) business hour of receipt of \nthe incident.  Once the incident has been confirmed, \nTyler shall use commercially reasonable efforts to \nresolve such support incidents or provide a \ncircumvention procedure within one (1) business \nday.  For non-hosted customers, Tyler’s responsibility \nfor lost or corrupted data is limited to assisting the \nClient in restoring its last available database. \n\nExhibit C \n \n 3 \nPriority \nLevel \nCharacteristics of Support Incident Resolution Targets\n*\n \n2 \nHigh \nSupport incident that causes (a) \nrepeated, consistent failure of \nessential functionality affecting more \nthan one user or (b) loss or corruption \nof data. \nTyler shall provide an initial response to Priority Level \n2 incidents within four (4) business hours of receipt of \nthe incident.  Once the incident has been confirmed, \nTyler shall use commercially reasonable efforts to \nresolve such support incidents or provide a \ncircumvention procedure within ten (10) business \ndays.  For non-hosted customers, Tyler’s \nresponsibility for loss or corrupted data is limited to \nassisting the Client in restoring its last available \ndatabase. \n3 \nMedium \nPriority Level 1 incident with an \nexisting circumvention procedure, or \na Priority Level 2 incident that affects \nonly one user or for which there is an \nexisting circumvention procedure. \nTyler shall provide an initial response to Priority Level \n3 incidents within one (1) business day of receipt of \nthe incident.  Once the incident has been confirmed, \nTyler shall use commercially reasonable efforts to \nresolve such support incidents without the need for a \ncircumvention procedure with the next published \nmaintenance update or service pack, which shall \noccur at least quarterly.  For non-hosted customers, \nTyler’s responsibility for lost or corrupted data is \nlimited to assisting the Client in restoring its last \navailable database. \n4 \nNon-\ncritical \nSupport incident that causes failure of \nnon-essential functionality or a \ncosmetic or other issue that does not \nqualify as any other Priority Level. \nTyler shall provide an initial response to Priority Level \n4 incidents within two (2) business days of receipt of \nthe incident.  Once the incident has been confirmed, \nTyler shall use commercially reasonable efforts to \nresolve such support incidents, as well as cosmetic \nissues, with a future version release. \n*\nResponse and Resolution Targets may differ by product or business need \n \nIncident Escalation  \n \nIf Tyler is unable to resolve any priority level 1 or 2 defect as listed above or the priority of an issue has \nelevated since initiation, you may escalate the incident to the appropriate resource, as outlined by each \nproduct support team.  The corresponding resource will meet with you and any Tyler staff to establish a \nmutually agreeable plan for addressing the defect. \nRemote Support Tool \n \nSome support calls may require further analysis of the Client’s database, processes or setup to diagnose \na problem or to assist with a question. Tyler will, at its discretion, use an industry-standard remote \nsupport tool. Tyler’s support team must have the ability to quickly connect to the Client’s system and \nview the site’s setup, diagnose problems, or assist with screen navigation. More information about the \nremote support tool Tyler uses is available upon request.     \n\nExhibit C \n \n 4 \n \n \nExhibit D \nStatement of Work \nThe following Statement of Work details the services to be delivered by us to you under your Agreement.  \nThis Statement of Work is effective as of the Effective Date.

Page | 4  \nPart 1: Executive Summary \n Project Overview \n Introduction \nTyler Technologies (“Tyler”) is the largest and most established provider of integrated software and \ntechnology services focused solely on the public sector. Tyler’s end-to-end solutions empower public sector \nentities including local, state, provincial and federal government, to operate more efficiently and connect \nmore transparently with their constituents and with each other. By connecting data and processes across \ndisparate systems, Tyler’s solutions transform how clients gain actionable insights that solve problems in their \ncommunities.  \n Project Goals \nThis Statement of Work (“SOW”) documents the methodology, implementation stages, activities, and roles \nand responsibilities, and project scope listed in the Investment Summary of the Agreement between Tyler \nand the Long Beach (collectively the “Project”). \nThe overall goals of the project are to: \n Successfully implement the contracted scope on time and on budget \n Increase operational efficiencies and empower users to be more productive \n Improve accessibility and responsiveness to external and internal customer needs \n Overcome current challenges and meet future goals \n Methodology \nThis is accomplished by the Long Beach and Tyler working as a partnership and Tyler utilizing its depth of \nimplementation experience. While each Project is unique, all will follow Tyler’s six-stage methodology. Each \nof the six stages is comprised of multiple work packages, and each work package includes a narrative \ndescription, objectives, tasks, inputs, outputs/deliverables, assumptions, and a responsibility matrix. \nTailored specifically for Tyler’s public sector clients, the project methodology contains Stage Acceptance \nControl Points throughout each Phase to ensure adherence to scope, budget, timeline controls, effective \ncommunications, and quality standards. Clearly defined, the project methodology repeats consistently across \nPhases, and is scaled to meet the Long Beach’s complexity and organizational needs. \n\n \nLong Beach NY  \nTyler Technologies, Inc. Page | 5  \n \nThe methodology adapts to both single-phase and multiple-phase projects.  \nTo achieve Project success, it is imperative that both the Long Beach and Tyler commit to including the \nnecessary leadership and governance. During each stage of the Project, it is expected that the Long Beach and \nTyler Project teams work collaboratively to complete tasks. An underlying principle of Tyler’s Implementation \nprocess is to employ an iterative model where the Long Beach’s business processes are assessed, configured, \nvalidated, and refined cyclically in line with the project budget. This approach is used in multiple stages and \nwork packages as illustrated in the graphic below. \n \nThe delivery approach is systematic, which reduces variability and mitigates risks to ensure Project success. As \nillustrated, some stages, along with work packages and tasks, are intended to be overlapping by nature to \ncomplete the Project efficiently and effectively.  \n\n \nLong Beach NY  \nTyler Technologies, Inc. Page | 6  \nPart 2: Project Foundation \n Project Governance \nProject governance is the management framework within which Project decisions are made. The role of \nProject governance is to provide a decision-making approach that is logical, robust, and repeatable. This \nallows organizations to have a structured approach for conducting its daily business in addition to project \nrelated activities. \nThis section outlines the resources required to meet the business needs, objectives, and priorities for the \nProject, communicate the goals to other Project participants, and provide support and guidance to \naccomplish these goals. Project governance defines the structure for escalation of issues and risks, Change \nControl review and authority, and Organizational Change Management activities. Throughout the Statement \nof Work Tyler has provided RACI Matrices for activities to be completed throughout the implementation \nwhich will further outline responsibilities of different roles in each stage. Further refinement of the \ngovernance structure, related processes, and specific roles and responsibilities occurs during the Initiate & \nPlan Stage. \nThe chart below illustrates an overall team perspective where Tyler and the Long Beach collaborate to resolve \nProject challenges according to defined escalation paths. If project managers do not possess authority to \ndetermine a solution, resolve an issue, or mitigate a risk, Tyler implementation management and the Long \nBeach Steering Committee become the escalation points to triage responses prior to escalation to the Long \nBeach and Tyler executive sponsors. As part of the escalation process, each Project governance tier presents \nrecommendations and supporting information to facilitate knowledge transfer and issue resolution. The Long \nBeach and Tyler executive sponsors serve as the final escalation point.  \n \n \n\n \nLong Beach NY  \nTyler Technologies, Inc. Page | 7  \n Project Scope Control \n Managing Scope and Project Change \nProject Management governance principles contend that there are three connected constraints on a Project: \nbudget, timeline, and scope. These constraints, known as the “triple constraints” or project management \ntriangle, define budget in terms of financial cost, labor costs, and other resource costs. Scope is defined as the \nwork performed to deliver a product, service or result with the specified features and functions, while time is \nsimply defined as the schedule. The Triple Constraint theory states that if you change one side of the triangle, \nthe other two sides must be correspondingly adjusted. For example, if the scope of the Project is increased, \ncost and time to complete will also need to increase. The Project and executive teams will need to remain \ncognizant of these constraints when making impactful decisions to the Project. A simple illustration of this \ntriangle is included here, showing the connection of each item and their relational impact to the overall \nScope. \n \nA pillar of any successful project is the ability to properly manage scope while allowing the appropriate level \nof flexibility to incorporate approved changes. Scope and changes within the project will be managed using \nthe change control process outlined in the following section. \n Change Control \nIt may become necessary to change the scope of this Project due to unforeseeable circumstances (e.g., new \nconstraints or opportunities are discovered). This Project is being undertaken with the understanding that \nProject scope, schedule, and/or cost may need to change to produce optimal results for stakeholders. \nChanges to contractual requirements will follow the change control process specified in the final contract, \nand as described below. \n Change Request Management \nShould the need for a change to Project scope, schedule, and/or cost be identified during the Project, the \nchange will be brought to the attention of the Steering Committee and an assessment of the change will \noccur. While such changes may result in additional costs and delays relative to the schedule, some changes \nmay result in less cost to the Long Beach; for example, the Long Beach may decide it no longer needs a \ndeliverable originally defined in the Project. The Change Request will include the following information:  \n\n \nLong Beach NY  \nTyler Technologies, Inc. Page | 8  \n The nature of the change. \n A good faith estimate of the additional cost or associated savings to the Long Beach, if any. \n The timetable for implementing the change. \n The effect on and/or risk to the schedule, resource needs or resource responsibilities. \nThe Long Beach will use its good faith efforts to either approve or disapprove any Change Request within ten \n(10) Business Days (or other period as mutually agreeable between Tyler and the Long Beach). Any changes to \nthe Project scope, budget, or timeline must be documented and approved in writing using a Change Request \nform. These changes constitute a formal amendment to the Statement of Work and will supersede any \nconflicting term in the Statement of Work.  \n \n\n \nLong Beach NY  \nTyler Technologies, Inc. Page | 9  \n Acceptance Process \nThe implementation of a Project involves many decisions to be made throughout its lifecycle. Decisions will \nvary from higher level strategy decisions to smaller, detailed Project level decisions. It is critical to the success \nof the Project that each Long Beach office or department designates specific individuals for making decisions \non behalf of their offices or departments. \nBoth Tyler and the Long Beach will identify representative project managers. These individuals will represent \nthe interests of all stakeholders and serve as the primary contacts between the two organizations.  \nThe coordination of gaining Long Beach feedback and approval on Project deliverables will be critical to the \nsuccess of the Project. The Long Beach project manager will strive to gain deliverable and decision approvals \nfrom all authorized Long Beach representatives. Given that the designated decision-maker for each \ndepartment may not always be available, there must be a designated proxy for each decision point in the \nProject. Assignment of each proxy will be the responsibility of the leadership from each Long Beach \ndepartment. The proxies will be named individuals that have the authorization to make decisions on behalf of \ntheir department. \nThe following process will be used for accepting Deliverables and Control Points: \n The Long Beach shall have ten (10) business days from the date of delivery, or as otherwise mutually \nagreed upon by the parties in writing, to accept each Deliverable or Control Point. If the Long Beach \ndoes not provide acceptance or acknowledgement within ten (10) business days, or the otherwise \nagreed upon timeframe, not to be unreasonably withheld, Tyler deems the Deliverable or Control \nPoint as accepted.  \n If the Long Beach does not agree the Deliverable or Control Point meets requirements, the Long \nBeach shall notify Tyler project manager(s), in writing, with reasoning within five (5) business days, or \nthe otherwise agreed-upon timeframe, not to be unreasonably withheld, of receipt of the \nDeliverable.  \n Tyler shall address any deficiencies and redeliver the Deliverable or Control Point. The Long Beach \nshall then have (a) two (2) business days from receipt of the redelivered Deliverable or Control Point \nto acknowledge that receipt and (b) five (5) business days from receipt of the redelivered Deliverable \nor Control Point to accept or again submit written notification of reasons for rejecting the milestone. \nIf the Long Beach does not provide acceptance within that five (5) business day period, or the \notherwise agreed upon timeframe, not to be unreasonably withheld, Tyler deems the Deliverable or \nControl Point as accepted.  \n Roles and Responsibilities \nThe following defines the roles and responsibilities of each Project resource for the Long Beach and Tyler. \nRoles and responsibilities may not follow the organizational chart or position descriptions at the Long Beach, \nbut are roles defined within the Project. It is common for individual resources on both the Tyler and Long \nBeach project teams to fill multiple roles. Similarly, it is common for some roles to be filled by multiple \npeople. \n Tyler Roles & Responsibilities \nTyler assigns a project manager prior to the start of each Phase of the Project (some Projects may only be one \nPhase in duration). Additional Tyler resources are assigned as the schedule develops and as needs arise.  \n\n \nLong Beach NY  \nTyler Technologies, Inc.

Tyler can offer a comprehensive solution that allows \nfor the unique nature of each client’s business processes. Though opportunities to enhance Tyler products \nmay exist, Tyler recommends Clients utilize existing functionality and, when necessary, adjust their business \npractices to the products; application refinements and enhancements should only be considered when no \n\n \nLong Beach NY  \nTyler Technologies, Inc. Page | 27  \nviable solution for a given process is available within the included Tyler products. We do recognize that some \nProjects may require modifications to the solution(s) to meet certain Long Beach business needs, including \ninterfaces with 3\nrd\n party products, custom reports, or other custom product modifications. Some Projects \nhave specific modifications included in the Project budget, others do not.

There are a few assumptions which, when acknowledged and \nadhered to, will support a successful implementation. Assumptions related to specific work packages are \ndocumented throughout the SOW. Included here are general assumptions which should be considered \nthroughout the overall implementation process.  \n Project \n Project activities will begin after the Agreement has been fully executed. \n The Long Beach Project Team will complete their necessary assignments in a mutually agreed upon \ntimeframe to meet the scheduled go-live date, as outlined in the Project Schedule. \n Sessions will be scheduled and conducted at a mutually agreeable time. \n Additional services, software modules and modifications not described in the SOW or Agreement will \nbe considered a change to this Project and will require a Change Request Form as previously \nreferenced in the definition of the Change Control Process. \n Tyler will provide a written agenda and notice of any prerequisites to the Long Beach project \nmanager(s) ten (10) business days or as otherwise mutually agreed upon time frame prior to any \nscheduled on-site or remote sessions, as applicable.  \n Tyler will provide guidance for configuration and processing options available within the Tyler \nsoftware. If multiple options are presented by Tyler, the Long Beach is responsible for making \ndecisions based on the options available.  \n Implementation of new software may require changes to existing processes, both business and \ntechnical, requiring the Long Beach to make process changes.  \n\n \nLong Beach NY  \nTyler Technologies, Inc. Page | 46  \n The Long Beach is responsible for defining, documenting, and implementing their policies that result \nfrom any business process changes.  \n Organizational Change Management \nUnless otherwise contracted by Tyler, Long Beach is responsible for managing Organizational Change. \nImpacted Long Beach resources will need consistent coaching and reassurance from their leadership team to \nembrace and accept the changes being imposed by the move to new software. An important part of change is \nensuring that impacted Long Beach resources understand the value of the change, and why they are being \nasked to change. \n Resources and Scheduling \n Long Beach resources will participate in scheduled activities as assigned in the Project Schedule. \n The Long Beach team will complete prerequisites prior to applicable scheduled activities. Failure to \ndo so may affect the schedule. \n Tyler and the Long Beach will provide resources to support the efforts to complete the Project as \nscheduled and within the constraints of the Project budget. \n Abbreviated timelines and overlapped Phases require sufficient resources to complete all required \nwork as scheduled.  \n Changes to the Project Schedule, availability of resources or changes in Scope will be requested \nthrough a Change Request. Impacts to the triple constraints (scope, budget, and schedule) will be \nassessed and documented as part of the change control process.  \n The Long Beach will ensure assigned resources will follow the change control process and possess the \nrequired business knowledge to complete their assigned tasks successfully. Should there be a change \nin resources, the replacement resource should have a comparable level of availability, change control \nprocess buy-in, and knowledge. \n The Long Beach makes timely Project related decisions to achieve scheduled due dates on tasks and \nprepare for subsequent training sessions. Failure to do so may affect the schedule, as each analysis \nand implementation session is dependent on the decisions made in prior sessions.  \n The Long Beach will respond to information requests in a comprehensive and timely manner, in \naccordance with the Project Schedule.  \n The Long Beach will provide adequate meeting space or facilities, including appropriate system \nconnectivity, to the project teams including Tyler team members. \n For on-site visits, Tyler will identify a travel schedule that balances the needs of the project and the \nemployee.  \n Data \n Data will be converted as provided and Tyler will not create data that does not exist.  \n The Long Beach is responsible for the quality of legacy data and for cleaning or scrubbing erroneous \nlegacy data.  \n Tyler will work closely with the Long Beach representatives to identify business rules before writing \nthe conversion. The Long Beach must confirm that all known data mapping from source to target \nhave been identified and documented before Tyler writes the conversion.  \n All in-scope source data is in data extract(s). \n Each legacy system data file submitted for conversion includes all associated records in a single \napproved file layout. \n\n \nLong Beach NY  \nTyler Technologies, Inc. Page | 47  \n The Long Beach will provide the legacy system data extract in the same format for each iteration \nunless changes are mutually agreed upon in advance. If not, negative impacts to the schedule, budget \nand resource availability may occur and/or data in the new system may be incorrect. \n The Long Beach Project Team is responsible for reviewing the converted data and reporting issues \nduring each iteration, with assistance from Tyler. \n The Long Beach is responsible for providing or entering test data (e.g., data for training, testing \ninterfaces, etc.)  \n Facilities \n The Long Beach will provide dedicated space for Tyler staff to work with Long Beach resources for \nboth on-site and remote sessions. If Phases overlap, Long Beach will provide multiple training \nfacilities to allow for independent sessions scheduling without conflict.  \n The Long Beach will provide staff with a location to practice what they have learned without \ndistraction.  \n  \n\n \nLong Beach NY  \nTyler Technologies, Inc.

CONFIDENTIAL/TRADE SECRET MATERIALS \nContractor confidential trade secret or proprietary \nmaterials as defined by the laws of the State of New \nYork must be clearly marked and identified as such \nupon submission by the Bidder.  Marking the Bid as \n“confidential” or “proprietary” on its face or in the \ndocument header or footer shall not be considered \nby the Purchasing Agent to be sufficient without \nspecific justification as to why disclosure of particular \ninformation in the Bid would cause substantial injury \nto the competitive position of the Bidder.  \nBidders/Contractors intending to seek an exemption \nfrom disclosure of these materials under the \nFreedom of Information Law must request the \nexemption in writing, setting forth the reasons for \nthe claimed exemption.

Where a Freedom of \nInformation request is made for trademark or other \nconfidential or proprietary information, the \nPurchasing Agent reserves the right to determine \nupon written notice to the Bidder whether such \ninformation qualifies for the exemption for disclosure \nunder the law.  Notwithstanding the above, where a \nBid tabulation is prepared and Bids publicly opened, \nsuch Bid tabulation shall be available upon request.  \n \n15.

SAMPLES   \nA. Standard Samples  Bid Specifications may indicate \nthat the Product to be purchased must be equal to a \nstandard sample on display in a place designated by \nthe Purchasing Agent and such sample will be made \navailable to the Bidder for examination prior to the \nopening date.  Failure by the Bidder to examine such \nsample shall not entitle the Bidder to any relief from \nthe conditions imposed by the Bid Specifications.  \nB. Bidder Supplied Samples  The Purchasing Agent \nreserves the right to request from the \nBidder/Contractor a representative sample(s) of the \nProduct offered at any time prior to or after award of \na contract.

Where applicable, \nsamples must be properly labeled with the \nappropriate Bid or Contract reference.  \n  \nA sample may be held by the Purchasing Agent \nduring the entire term of the Contract and for a \nreasonable period thereafter for comparison with \ndeliveries.  At the conclusion of the holding period \nthe sample, where feasible, will be returned as \ninstructed by the Bidder, at the Bidder’s expense and \nrisk.  Where the Bidder has failed to fully instruct the \nPurchasing Agent as to the return of the sample (i.e., \nmode and place of return, etc.) or refuses to bear the \ncost of its return, the sample shall become the sole \nproperty of the receiving entity at the conclusion of \nthe holding period.  \n  \nC. Enhanced Samples  When an approved sample \nexceeds the minimum specifications, all Product \ndelivered must be of the same enhanced quality and \nidentity as the sample.  Thereafter, in the event of a \nContractor’s default, the Purchasing Agent may \nprocure a Product substantially equal to the \nenhanced sample from other sources, charging the \nContractor for any additional costs incurred.  \n \n \nD. Conformance with Sample(s)  Submission of a \nsample (whether or not such sample is tested by, or \nfor, the City) and approval thereof shall not relieve \nthe Contractor from full compliance with all terms \nand conditions, performance related and otherwise, \nspecified in the Bid Specifications.  If in the judgment \nof the City the sample or product submitted is not in \naccordance with the specifications or testing \nrequirements prescribed in the Bid Specifications, the \nCity may reject the Bid.  If an award has been made, \nthe City may cancel the Contract at the expense of \nthe Contractor.  \nE. Testing  All samples are subject to tests in the \nmanner and place designated by the City, either prior \nto or after Contract award.  Unless otherwise stated \nin the Bid Specifications, Bidder samples consumed \nor rendered useless by testing will not be returned to \nthe Bidder.  Testing costs for samples that fails to \nmeet Contract requirements may be at the expense \nof the Contractor.  \n  \nSAMPLES MUST BE SUBMITTED IN STRICT \nACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION.  THE CITY \nRETAINS THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO REJECT ANY BID \nFOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS SECTION.  \n \nBID EVALUATION  \n  \n26.

A conditional or revocable Bid which clearly \ncommunicates the terms or limitations of acceptance \nmay be considered, and Contract award may be \nmade in compliance with the Bidder’s conditional or \nrevocable terms in the offer.  \n  \n27. CONDITIONAL BID Unless the Bid Specifications \nprovides otherwise, a Bid is not rendered non-\nresponsive if the Bidder specifies that the award will \nbe accepted only on all or a specified group of items \nor Product included in the specification.  It is \nunderstood that nothing herein shall be deemed to \nchange or alter the method of award contained in \nthe Bid Documents.  \n  \n28. CLARIFICATIONS / REVISIONS  Prior to award, the \nCity reserves the right to seek clarifications, request \nBid revisions, or to request any information deemed \nnecessary for proper evaluation of Bids from all \nBidders deemed to be eligible for Contract award.  \nFailure to provide requested information may result \nin rejection of the Bid.  \n  \n29. EQUIVALENT OR IDENTICAL BIDS  In the event \nthat two or more Bidders submit substantially \nequivalent Bids as to pricing or other factors, the \ndecision of the Purchasing Agent to award a Contract \nto one or more of such Bidders shall be final.  \n  \n30. PROMPT PAYMENT DISCOUNTS  While prompt \npayment discounts will not be considered in \ndetermining the low Bid, the Purchasing Agent may \nconsider any prompt payment discount in resolving \nBids which are otherwise tied.  However, any \nnotation indicating that the price is net, (e.g., net 30 \ndays), shall be understood to mean only that no \nprompt payment discount is offered by the Bidder.  \nThe imposition of service, interest, or other charges, \nexcept as otherwise permitted by law, may render \nthe Bid non-responsive and may be cause for its \nrejection.  \n  \n31. PERFORMANCE AND RESPONSIBILITY \nQUALIFICATIONS  The Purchasing Agent reserves the \nright to investigate or inspect at any time whether or \nnot the Product, services, qualifications or facilities \noffered by the Bidder/Contractor meet the \nrequirements set forth in the Bid \nSpecifications/Contract or as set forth during \nContract negotiations.  Contractor shall at all times \nduring the Contract term remain responsible and \nresponsive. If the Purchasing Agent determines that \nthe conditions and terms of the Bid Documents, Bid \nSpecifications or Contract are not complied with, or \nthat items, services or Product proposed to be \nfurnished do not meet the specified requirements, or \nthat the legal authority, integrity experience, ability, \nprior performance, organization and financial \ncapacity or facilities are not satisfactory, the \nPurchasing Agent may reject such Bid or terminate \nthe Contract.  \n  \n32. QUANTITY CHANGES PRIOR TO AWARD  The \nPurchasing Agent reserves the right, at any time prior \nto the award of a specific quantity Contract, to alter \nin good faith the quantities listed in the Bid \nSpecifications.  In the event such right is exercised, \nthe lowest responsible Bidder meeting Bid \nSpecifications will be advised of the revised \nquantities and afforded an opportunity to extend or \nreduce its Bid price in relation to the changed \nquantities.  Refusal by the low Bidder to so extend or \nreduce its Bid price may result in the rejection of its \nBid and the award of such Contract to the lowest \nresponsible Bidder who accepts the revised \nqualifications.  \n  \n33. TIMEFRAME FOR OFFERS  The City reserves the \nright to make awards within forty-five (45) days after \nopening of Bids, during which period, Bids must \nremain firm and cannot be withdrawn.  Any Bid \nwhich expressly states therein that acceptance must \nbe made within a shorter specified time, may at the \nsole discretion of the City, be accepted or rejected.  \n \n \nTERMS & CONDITIONS \n  \n34.

In \nsuch event, a copy of such terms shall be furnished to \nthe City by the Contractor at the time of such offer.  \n  \nOther than where such terms are more advantageous \nfor the City than those set forth in the Contract, no \nalteration or modification of the terms of the \nContract, including substitution of Product, shall be \nvalid or binding against the City unless authorized by \nthe Purchasing Agent.  No such alteration or \nmodification shall be made by unilaterally affixing \nsuch terms to Product upon delivery (including, but \nnot limited to, attachment or inclusion of standard \npre-printed order forms, product literature, “shrink \nwrap” terms accompanying software upon delivery, \nor other documents) or by incorporating such terms \nonto order forms, purchase orders or other \ndocuments forwarded by the Contractor for \npayment, notwithstanding the City’s subsequent \nacceptance of Product, or that the City has \nsubsequently processed such document for approval \nor payment.  \n  \n36. SCOPE CHANGES  The City reserves the right, \nunilaterally, to require, by written order, changes by \naltering, adding to or deducting from the Bid \nSpecifications, such changes to be within the general \nscope of the Contract.  The City may make an \nequitable adjustment in the Contract price or \ndelivery date if the change affects the cost or time of \nperformance.  Such equitable adjustments require \nthe consent of the Contractor, which consent shall \nnot be unreasonably withheld.  \n \n37. ESTIMATED / SPECIFIC QUANTITY CONTRACTS  \nEstimated quantity contracts are expressly agreed \nand understood to be made for only the quantities, if \nany, actually ordered during the Contract term.  No \nguarantee of any quantity(s) is implied or given.  The \nCity will neither be compelled to order any quantities \nof any item nor will it be limited to the quantity \nindicated for any item.  The quantity to be ordered \nwill be such as may actually be required, as \ndetermined by the City.  The City retains the \nabsolute right to reject any Bid which expressly \nimposes a minimum order quantity or minimum \ndollar amount.  Purchases by the City from Contracts \nfor services and technology are voluntary.  \n  \n38. EMERGENCY CONTRACTS In the event that a \ndisaster emergency is declared by the City, or it \ndetermines that an emergency exists requiring the \nprompt and immediate delivery of Product, the City \nreserves the right to obtain such Product from any \nsource, including but not limited to this Contract(s), \nas the City in its sole discretion determines will meet \nthe needs of such emergency.

As deemed necessary, the City \nmay confirm pricing and other Product information \nwith the Contractor prior to placement of the \nPurchase Order.  The City reserves the right to \nrequire any other information from the Contractor \nwhich the City deems necessary in order to complete \nany Purchase Order placed under the Contract.  \nShould the City add written terms and conditions to \nthe Purchase Order that conflict with the terms and \nconditions of the Contract, the Contractor has the \noption of rejecting the Purchase Order within five \nbusiness days of its receipt but shall first attempt to \nnegotiate the additional written terms and conditions \nin good faith with the City, or fulfill the Purchase \nOrder.  Notwithstanding the above, the City reserves \nthe right to dispute any discrepancies arising from \nthe presentation of additional terms and conditions \nwith the Contractor.  \n  \n40.

INTRODUCTION \n \n \nA.  General \n \nThe City of Long Beach (the ‘City”) is soliciting request for proposals (RFP) from qualified vendors to provide \nbeach park access control services for innovative and state-of-the-art alternative ways for residents/visitors to pay \nfor and use beach passes with no additional fee to the City along with ease of identification of valid beach pass \nholders.   These “beach park access control services” will allow the resident/visitor to purchase a season or daily \npass that include senior, veteran, access, child and adult passes sold in both resident and non-resident varieties.  \nIn addition, the City sells economy passes (10 packs) for both resident and non-resident daily passes and has a \nprogram with the Long Island Rail Road for a discount train/beach package \n \nThe City continues to experience an unprecedented level of growth within its beach front.  Each year, the City \nsells between 250,000-300,000 beach passes to residents and visitors allowing them the ability to utilize the \nCity’s 3.5 miles of beach along the Atlantic Ocean.  To date, sales of beach park access passes have been \naccomplished via in-person transactions and the issuance of a physical plastic pass; or electronically utilizing \ntheir phone.  Point-of-sale pass transactions typically take place at each beach entrance along with two (2) other \ndesignated areas or electronically in order to achieve the efficiencies and ancillary benefits of such. \n \nThe City is desirous of implementing a new control service that would allow the user an efficient experience to \nenjoy the City’s waterfront area while providing a more effective measure to beach pass validity and payment \ncompliance. \n \nThe award of this contract shall be made to the vendor whose proposal is deemed to be the most advantageous to \nthe City, in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFP.   \n \nThe beach park access control services solution should allow the visitor/customer (the “user”) to purchase a pass \nfrom any web-enabled device, such  as a smartphone, tablet or computer.   The solution should collect only the \nminimum amount of information required to complete the financial transaction and/or address the City’s other \nneeds.  Reporting of pass purchases and usage to the City is required.   All data is owned by the City of  Long \nBeach and shall not be used for any third-party purpose. \n \n \nThe following conditions apply to this RFP: \n \n There is no express or implied obligation of the City to reimburse responding firms for any expenses \nincurred in preparing proposals in response to this request, and the City will not reimburse such \nexpenses. \n \n\nCity of Long Beach                                                                   Beach Park Access Control Services  \nPurchasing Department  Page 4 \n \n This is a service contract.

The City reserves the right to reject any or all proposals \nsubmitted. \n \n During the evaluation process, the City reserves the right, where it may serve the City’s best interest, \nto request additional information or clarification from a proposer, or to allow corrections on non-\nmaterial errors or omissions or waive non-material requirements.  At the sole discretion of the City, \nfirms submitting proposals may be requested to make oral presentations as part of the evaluation \nprocess.  If conducted, oral presentations will be scheduled with each proposer being considered. \n \n The City reserves the right to retain all proposals submitted and to use any ideas in a proposal \nregardless of whether that proposal is selected. \n \n Submission of a proposal indicates acceptance by the firm of the conditions contained in this RFP, \nunless clearly and specifically noted in the proposal submitted and confirmed in the contract between \nthe City and the selected firm. \n \n It is anticipated the selection of a firm will be completed in January, 2025.  Following notification of \nthe selected firm, it is expected an agreement will be executed between both parties in or about \nFebruary, 2025. \n \n The City reserves the right, as best serves its interest, to change any of the projected dates set forth in \nthis RFP including, but not limited to, the due date for receipt of proposals. \n \nThe City reserves the right to reject all proposals. \n \n  \nB.

SUMMARY AND TIMELINE \n1.1. Summary \nThe Cooperative Purchasing Program (HGACBuy) of the Houston-Galveston Area Council of \nGovernments is soliciting offerings for the furnishing of products/services as described in this \nSolicitation. Texas Local Government Code (Title 7, Chapters 771 and 791) establishes the authority for \nH-GAC to provide cooperative contract products and services to Texas local governments and in other \nstates if their statutes allow. With that authority, H-GAC makes varied categories of contracted products \nand services available. \n1.2. Background \nAbout the Cooperative \nH-GAC is a government agency which provides a Cooperative Purchasing Program as part of its service to \nother government agencies. The Program currently makes blanket type contracts covering products and \nservices for the use of its membership of more than 4500 local government participants in Texas and \nother States (Customers) which include cities, counties, emergency services districts, school districts, \nand non-profit organizations. Any local government or non-profit organization may participate in the \nProgram if their state law allows. There is no cost to join and become a member of the H-GAC \nCooperative Purchasing Program. \nH-GAC's Cooperative Purchasing Program, known as HGACBuy, was established pursuant to Texas \nInterlocal Cooperation Act [Texas Local Government Code, Title 7, Chapter 791]. The Act allows local \ngovernments and certain non-profits to contract or agree under the terms of the Act to make purchases \nor provide purchasing services and other administrative functions appropriately established by another \ngovernment entity. The Interlocal Contract (ILC) is the required legal document that establishes a link \nbetween the Customer (local governments and certain non-profits) and HGACBuy and gives the \nCustomer access to HGACBuy contracts. \nHGACBuy contracts are established based on the requirements of Texas Local Government Code, \nChapter 252 and/or other applicable State of Texas or Federal procurement requirements. Products and \nservices are contracted after having been subjected to either a competitive bid (ITB); competitive \nproposal (RFP); or Request for Qualification and Pre-Qualification (RFQ) depending on the category type. \nContracts are blanket type, usually for a term of two (2) or three (3) years. Use of HGACBuy for \npurchases by any Customer is strictly at the discretion of that entity. Customers issue purchase orders \nand pay the HGACBuy Contractor directly. The Customer also sends HGACBuy a copy of the purchase \norder and the Contractor is responsible for reporting the sale to HGACBuy as a contract requirement. \n1.3.

CONFIDENTIAL/TRADE SECRET MATERIALS \nContractor confidential trade secret or proprietary \nmaterials as defined by the laws of the State of New \nYork must be clearly marked and identified as such \nupon submission by the Bidder.

Bidder Supplied Samples  The Purchasing Agent \nreserves the right to request from the \nBidder/Contractor a representative sample(s) of the \nProduct offered at any time prior to or after award of \na contract.  Unless otherwise instructed, samples \nshall be furnished within the time specified in the \nrequest.  Untimely submission of a sample may \nconstitute grounds for rejection of Bid or cancellation \nof the Contract.  Samples must be submitted free of \ncharge and be accompanied by the Bidder’s name \nand address, any descriptive literature relating to the \nProduct and a statement indicating how and where \nthe sample is to be returned.  Where applicable, \nsamples must be properly labeled with the \nappropriate Bid or Contract reference.  \n  \nA sample may be held by the Purchasing Agent \nduring the entire term of the Contract and for a \nreasonable period thereafter for comparison with \ndeliveries.  At the conclusion of the holding period \nthe sample, where feasible, will be returned as \ninstructed by the Bidder, at the Bidder’s expense and \nrisk.  Where the Bidder has failed to fully instruct the \nPurchasing Agent as to the return of the sample (i.e., \nmode and place of return, etc.) or refuses to bear the \ncost of its return, the sample shall become the sole \nproperty of the receiving entity at the conclusion of \nthe holding period.  \n  \nC. Enhanced Samples  When an approved sample \nexceeds the minimum specifications, all Product \ndelivered must be of the same enhanced quality and \nidentity as the sample.  Thereafter, in the event of a \nContractor’s default, the Purchasing Agent may \nprocure a Product substantially equal to the \nenhanced sample from other sources, charging the \nContractor for any additional costs incurred.  \n \n \nD. Conformance with Sample(s)  Submission of a \nsample (whether or not such sample is tested by, or \nfor, the City) and approval thereof shall not relieve \nthe Contractor from full compliance with all terms \nand conditions, performance related and otherwise, \nspecified in the Bid Specifications.  If in the judgment \nof the City the sample or product submitted is not in \naccordance with the specifications or testing \nrequirements prescribed in the Bid Specifications, the \nCity may reject the Bid.  If an award has been made, \nthe City may cancel the Contract at the expense of \nthe Contractor.  \nE. Testing  All samples are subject to tests in the \nmanner and place designated by the City, either prior \nto or after Contract award.  Unless otherwise stated \nin the Bid Specifications, Bidder samples consumed \nor rendered useless by testing will not be returned to \nthe Bidder.  Testing costs for samples that fails to \nmeet Contract requirements may be at the expense \nof the Contractor.  \n  \nSAMPLES MUST BE SUBMITTED IN STRICT \nACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION.  THE CITY \nRETAINS THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO REJECT ANY BID \nFOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS SECTION.  \n \nBID EVALUATION  \n  \n26. BID EVALUATION The City reserves the right to \naccept or reject any and all Bids, or separable \nportions of offers, and waive technicalities, \nirregularities, and omissions if the City determines \nthe best interests of the City will be served.

CONDITIONAL BID Unless the Bid Specifications \nprovides otherwise, a Bid is not rendered non-\nresponsive if the Bidder specifies that the award will \nbe accepted only on all or a specified group of items \nor Product included in the specification.  It is \nunderstood that nothing herein shall be deemed to \nchange or alter the method of award contained in \nthe Bid Documents.  \n  \n28. CLARIFICATIONS / REVISIONS  Prior to award, the \nCity reserves the right to seek clarifications, request \nBid revisions, or to request any information deemed \nnecessary for proper evaluation of Bids from all \nBidders deemed to be eligible for Contract award.  \nFailure to provide requested information may result \nin rejection of the Bid.  \n  \n29. EQUIVALENT OR IDENTICAL BIDS  In the event \nthat two or more Bidders submit substantially \nequivalent Bids as to pricing or other factors, the \ndecision of the Purchasing Agent to award a Contract \nto one or more of such Bidders shall be final.  \n  \n30. PROMPT PAYMENT DISCOUNTS  While prompt \npayment discounts will not be considered in \ndetermining the low Bid, the Purchasing Agent may \nconsider any prompt payment discount in resolving \nBids which are otherwise tied.  However, any \nnotation indicating that the price is net, (e.g., net 30 \ndays), shall be understood to mean only that no \nprompt payment discount is offered by the Bidder.  \nThe imposition of service, interest, or other charges, \nexcept as otherwise permitted by law, may render \nthe Bid non-responsive and may be cause for its \nrejection.  \n  \n31. PERFORMANCE AND RESPONSIBILITY \nQUALIFICATIONS  The Purchasing Agent reserves the \nright to investigate or inspect at any time whether or \nnot the Product, services, qualifications or facilities \noffered by the Bidder/Contractor meet the \nrequirements set forth in the Bid \nSpecifications/Contract or as set forth during \nContract negotiations.

If the Purchasing Agent determines that \nthe conditions and terms of the Bid Documents, Bid \nSpecifications or Contract are not complied with, or \nthat items, services or Product proposed to be \nfurnished do not meet the specified requirements, or \nthat the legal authority, integrity experience, ability, \nprior performance, organization and financial \ncapacity or facilities are not satisfactory, the \nPurchasing Agent may reject such Bid or terminate \nthe Contract.  \n  \n32. QUANTITY CHANGES PRIOR TO AWARD  The \nPurchasing Agent reserves the right, at any time prior \nto the award of a specific quantity Contract, to alter \nin good faith the quantities listed in the Bid \nSpecifications.  In the event such right is exercised, \nthe lowest responsible Bidder meeting Bid \nSpecifications will be advised of the revised \nquantities and afforded an opportunity to extend or \nreduce its Bid price in relation to the changed \nquantities.  Refusal by the low Bidder to so extend or \nreduce its Bid price may result in the rejection of its \nBid and the award of such Contract to the lowest \nresponsible Bidder who accepts the revised \nqualifications.  \n  \n33. TIMEFRAME FOR OFFERS  The City reserves the \nright to make awards within forty-five (45) days after \nopening of Bids, during which period, Bids must \nremain firm and cannot be withdrawn.  Any Bid \nwhich expressly states therein that acceptance must \nbe made within a shorter specified time, may at the \nsole discretion of the City, be accepted or rejected.  \n \n \nTERMS & CONDITIONS \n  \n34.

No such alteration or \nmodification shall be made by unilaterally affixing \nsuch terms to Product upon delivery (including, but \nnot limited to, attachment or inclusion of standard \npre-printed order forms, product literature, “shrink \nwrap” terms accompanying software upon delivery, \nor other documents) or by incorporating such terms \nonto order forms, purchase orders or other \ndocuments forwarded by the Contractor for \npayment, notwithstanding the City’s subsequent \nacceptance of Product, or that the City has \nsubsequently processed such document for approval \nor payment.  \n  \n36. SCOPE CHANGES  The City reserves the right, \nunilaterally, to require, by written order, changes by \naltering, adding to or deducting from the Bid \nSpecifications, such changes to be within the general \nscope of the Contract.

ESTIMATED / SPECIFIC QUANTITY CONTRACTS  \nEstimated quantity contracts are expressly agreed \nand understood to be made for only the quantities, if \nany, actually ordered during the Contract term.

The quantity to be ordered \nwill be such as may actually be required, as \ndetermined by the City.  The City retains the \nabsolute right to reject any Bid which expressly \nimposes a minimum order quantity or minimum \ndollar amount.

As deemed necessary, the City \nmay confirm pricing and other Product information \nwith the Contractor prior to placement of the \nPurchase Order.  The City reserves the right to \nrequire any other information from the Contractor \nwhich the City deems necessary in order to complete \nany Purchase Order placed under the Contract.  \nShould the City add written terms and conditions to \nthe Purchase Order that conflict with the terms and \nconditions of the Contract, the Contractor has the \noption of rejecting the Purchase Order within five \nbusiness days of its receipt but shall first attempt to \nnegotiate the additional written terms and conditions \nin good faith with the City, or fulfill the Purchase \nOrder.  Notwithstanding the above, the City reserves \nthe right to dispute any discrepancies arising from \nthe presentation of additional terms and conditions \nwith the Contractor.  \n  \n40.

Purchase from other sources \n(without recourse to and by the Contractor for the \ncosts and expenses thereof) to replace all or part of \nthe Products which are the subject of the delay, may \nbe deducted from the Contract quantities without \npenalty or liability to the City.

SUMMARY AND TIMELINE \n1.1. Summary \nThe Cooperative Purchasing Program (HGACBuy) of the Houston-Galveston Area Council of \nGovernments is soliciting offerings for the furnishing of products/services as described in this \nSolicitation. Texas Local Government Code (Title 7, Chapters 771 and 791) establishes the authority for \nH-GAC to provide cooperative contract products and services to Texas local governments and in other \nstates if their statutes allow. With that authority, H-GAC makes varied categories of contracted products \nand services available. \n1.2. Background \nAbout the Cooperative \nH-GAC is a government agency which provides a Cooperative Purchasing Program as part of its service to \nother government agencies. The Program currently makes blanket type contracts covering products and \nservices for the use of its membership of more than 4500 local government participants in Texas and \nother States (Customers) which include cities, counties, emergency services districts, school districts, \nand non-profit organizations. Any local government or non-profit organization may participate in the \nProgram if their state law allows. There is no cost to join and become a member of the H-GAC \nCooperative Purchasing Program. \nH-GAC's Cooperative Purchasing Program, known as HGACBuy, was established pursuant to Texas \nInterlocal Cooperation Act [Texas Local Government Code, Title 7, Chapter 791]. The Act allows local \ngovernments and certain non-profits to contract or agree under the terms of the Act to make purchases \nor provide purchasing services and other administrative functions appropriately established by another \ngovernment entity. The Interlocal Contract (ILC) is the required legal document that establishes a link \nbetween the Customer (local governments and certain non-profits) and HGACBuy and gives the \nCustomer access to HGACBuy contracts. \nHGACBuy contracts are established based on the requirements of Texas Local Government Code, \nChapter 252 and/or other applicable State of Texas or Federal procurement requirements. Products and \nservices are contracted after having been subjected to either a competitive bid (ITB); competitive \nproposal (RFP); or Request for Qualification and Pre-Qualification (RFQ) depending on the category type. \nContracts are blanket type, usually for a term of two (2) or three (3) years. Use of HGACBuy for \npurchases by any Customer is strictly at the discretion of that entity. Customers issue purchase orders \nand pay the HGACBuy Contractor directly. The Customer also sends HGACBuy a copy of the purchase \norder and the Contractor is responsible for reporting the sale to HGACBuy as a contract requirement. \n1.3.

Any Lead Respondent utilizing a dealer/reseller network who is awarded a \ncontract will be responsible for the processing of the Purchase Order through the network and the \nactivities of the sale, reporting requirements, and remittance of applicable order processing fees. \n4.8.

The Fee is calculated from awarded bid pricing before additional discounts (if any) have been \napplied.

Please keep this document as proof of your \nregistration.\nThis Certificate is valid for two (2) years, unless revoked or suspended.\nIf you bid or commence work on a public work project or covered private project without being properly \nregistered, you may be subject to a civil penalty and denial of your registration application pursuant to NYS\nLL § 220-I(8).\nIf your registration or a subcontractor’s registration lapses while performing contracted work on a covered \nproject, the work for that project may be completed. \nIf you are determined unfit and your certificate is revoked or suspended, then a monitor approved by the \nCommissioner must be appointed to oversee the completion of the work at your expense. \nIf your certificate is to be suspended or revoked for any reason, you will receive a notice and an \nopportunity to contest at a hearing prior to the suspension or revocation taking effect. \nPlease note that any subcontractors or independent contractors you hire to work on a public work or \ncovered private construction project must obtain their own Certificate of Contractor Registration to perform \nsuch work.\nIf you allow a subcontractor or independent

Tenant may, however, at Tenant’s expense, \nmake a separate claim to the appropriate Authority for the value of Tenant’s Property and for \nmoving expenses, provided such claim and award, if any, do not result in a reduction of the \naward which would otherwise be paid to Landlord.  If a taking does not result in the termination \nof this lease (i) Landlord shall, at Landlord’s expense, as soon as practicable, restore that part of \nthe Premises or the Real Property not taken to the extent reasonably practicable, so that the \nPremises are usable, and (ii) from and after the date of the vesting of title, the Rent shall be \nreduced in the same proportion as the area of the Premises, if any, which was taken. \nArticle 15.

Tenant’s liability hereunder shall \nnot be affected by any modification of  this lease or agreement made between Landlord and any \nassignee or subtenant, or by reason of any delay or failure on Landlord’s part to enforce any of \nits rights under this lease; provided that if any such modification or agreement increases the \nobligation of the assignee under this    lease, the liability of the assignor-Tenant under this lease \nshall continue to be no greater than if such modification or agreement had not been made unless \nsuch assignee is a person or entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under \ncommon control with Tenant. \nSection 15.6 The consent by Landlord to any assignment, transfer, sublet, \noccupancy, encumbrance or other transaction described in this Section 15, shall not in any way \nbe deemed to relieve Tenant from obtaining the express consent of Landlord prior to any further \nsuch transaction or any proposed assignment of sublease or sub-sublease, which consent may be \ngranted or denied at Landlord’s so le discretion.   \nSection 15.7 The acceptance by Landlord of Rent following any assignment, \nsublease, encumbrance, license, occupancy, or other transaction in violation of this Article, shall \nnot be deemed a consent by Landlord to such transaction, nor a waiver of any right or remedy of \nLandlord hereunder. \nArticle 16. Access; Changes in Building and Real Property \nSection 16.1 Landlord reserves the right to (a) place (and have access to) \nconcealed ducts, pipes and conduits through the Premises (without a material reduction or \nreconfiguration of the useable area of the Premises), and (b) enter the Premises at reasonable \ntimes on reasonable prior notice, which may be oral (but prior notice shall not be required in an \nemergency), to inspect the Premises, to show the Premises to others or to perform any work or \nmake any improvement Landlord deems necessary or desirable to the Premises or the Building or \nfor the purpose of complying with Laws.  If Tenant is not present when Landlord desires to enter \n\n \n \n 20 \nthe Premises, Landlord or Landlord’s contractors may enter the Premises (by force, in the event \nof an emergency) without liability to Tenant. \nSection 16.2 Landlord reserves the right at any time and from time to time to  \n(a) make changes or revisions in the Real Property, including but not limited to the Building \nareas, walkways, driveways, parking areas, or other Common Areas, (b) construct improvements \nin the Real Property, (c) construct additions to, or additional stories on, the Building (which right \nincludes the right to make use of structural elements of the Premises, including without \nlimitation columns and footings, for such construction, provided such use does not materially \nencroach on the interior of the Premises), and (d) change the name, number or designation by \nwhich the Real Property and/or Building is known.  Landlord’s exercise of its rights pursuant to \nthis Sect ion shall not reduce the number of parking spaces serving the Real Property below that \nrequired by any Laws. \nSection 16.3 If there is to be any excavation or construction adjacent to the \nBuilding, Tenant shall permit Landlord and/or any other person to enter the Premises to perform \nsuch work as Landlord or that person deems necessary to protect the Building, without any \nabatement of the Rent or liability to Tenant. \nSection 16.4 Landlord shall have the exclusive right to use all or any part of the \nroof of the Building for any purpose,  and to erect temporary scaffolds and other aids to \nconstruction on the exterior of the Premises in connection with alterations, repairs, \nimprovements, and/or additions Landlord may make to the Building, provided that access to the \nPremises shall not be denied.  Landlord may make any use it desires of the side exterior walls or \nrear walls of the Building.  \nSection 16.5 Landlord shall exercise Landlord’s rights under this Article in a \nmanner which reasonably minimizes interference with the conduct of Tenant’s business in the \nPremises and damage to the Premises, Tenant’s Work and Tenant’s Property (all of which shall \npromptly be repaired by Landlord, at its expense), but Landlord is not required to employ \novertime labor or incur additional expenses. \nArticle 17. Default \nSection 17.1 Each of the following (a “Default”) is a material default by Tenant \nunder this lease: \n(a) Tenant fails to pay when due any Rent and the failure continues for Five \n(5) days following Landlord’s notice (which notice shall also be considered any demand required \nby any Laws).  If, however, Landlord gives such a notice of failure to pay Rent twice in any \ntwelve (12) month period, any additional failure to pay any Rent when due within that twelve \n(12) month period shall be considered a Default, without the requirement of any notice by \nLandlord, requiring Landlord to serve, by certified mail/return receipt requested, a Notice of \nDefault to Tenant advising Tenant that Tenant has 14 days from receipt of said Notice of Default \nto cure the default with the payment of the outstanding Rent. \n(b) Tenant fails to comply with Art icle 12 or Article 15 or makes any \nmisrepresentation under Section 25.2.     \n(c) Tenant fails to comply with Section 18.4 of this Agreement \n\n \n \n 21 \n(d) Tenant fails to comply with any other term of this lease and the failure \ncontinues for thirty (30) days following Landlord’s notice.  If, however, compliance cannot, with \ndiligence, reasonably be fully accomplished within that thirty (30) day period, Tenant shall have \nan additional period not to exceed forty-five (45) days to fully comply, provided Tenant notifies \nLandlord of its intention to comply (with reasonably detailed steps to be taken) and commences \ncompliance within that thirt y (30) day period and thereafter pursues compliance to completion \nwith diligence and provides Landlord with status updates on the progress at least every fifteen \n(15) days. \n(e) A third party institutes against Tenant or Guarantor, if any, any legal \naction seeking any relief from its debts under any applicable bankruptcy or insolvency Laws \nwhich is not dismissed within ninet y (90) days, or Tenant or Guarantor, if any, institutes any  \nlegal action seeking such relief, and/or a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official is \nappointed for Tenant or Guarantor, if any, or for all or a substantial portion of its assets, or \nTenant or Guarantor, if any, commits any other act indicating insolvency such as making an \nassignment for the benefit of its creditors. \n(f) Except as otherwise expressly permitted under this lease, Tenant vacates \nor abandons the Premises prior to the Expiration Date. \n(g) Tenant fails to comply with Rules and Food Use Rider, if applicable, more \nthan three (3) times in any Ocean Beach Park Season and upon written notice of same by \nLandlord. \n(h) Guarantor, if any, shall be in breach of its obligations under its guaranty of \nTenant's obligations under this lease.   \nSection 17.2 If a Default occurs, this lease is subject to the conditional \nlimitation that Landlord may, a  t any time during the continuance of the Default,  give notice to \nTenant that this lease shall terminate on the date specified in that notice, which date shall not be \nless than fourteen (14) days after Landlord gives such notice to Tenant.  If Landlord gives that \nnotice, this lease and the Term shall expire and come to an end on the date set forth in that notice \nas if said date were the date originally fixed in this lease as the Expiration Date and Tenant shall \nquit and surrender the Premises to Landlord (but Tenant shall remain liable as provided in this \nlease). \nSection 17.3 If Tenant is in arrears in the payment of Rent, Tenant waives \nTenant’s right, if any, to designate the items against which any payments made by Tenant are to \nbe credited, and Landlord may apply any payments made by Tenant to any items Landlord sees \nfit. \nArticle 18. Remedies \nSection 18.1 If this lease is terminated pursuant to Article 17 or Landlord \nreenters or obtains possession of the Premises by summary proceedings or any other legal action \nor by force or otherwise (which Landlord may do without further notice and without liability or \nobligation to Tenant or any occupant of the Premises), all of the provisions of this Section shall \napply (in addition to any other applicable provisions of this lease). \n\n \n \n 22 \n(a) Tenant, and all other occupants, shall vacate and surrender to Landlord the \nPremises in accordance with this lease. \n(b) Landlord, at Landlord’s option, may (i) relet the Premises, or any portion \nof the Premises, from time to time, in the name of Landlord, Tenant or otherwise, as determined \nby Landlord, to any person and on any terms, but Landlord shall have no obligation to relet the \nPremises, or any portion of the Premises, or to collect any rent (and the failure to relet the \nPremises, or any portion of the Premises, or to collect any rent shall not impose any liability or \nobligation on Landlord or relieve Tenant of any obligation or liability under this lease), and (ii) \nmake any changes to the Premises as Landlord, in Landlord’s judgment, considers advisable or \nnecessary in connection with a reletting, without imposing any liability or obligation on Landlord \nor relieving Tenant of any obligation or liability under this lease. \n(c) Tenant shall pay Landlord all Rent payable to the date on which this lease \nis terminated or Landlord re-enters or obtains possession of the Premises. \n(d) Tenant shall also pay to Landlord, as damages, any deficiency between (i) \nthe aggregate Rent for the period which otherwise would have constituted the unexpired portion \nof the Term and (ii) the rents, if any, applicable to that period collected under any reletting of all \nor any portion of the Premises.  Tenant shall pay any deficiency in annual installments on the \ndays specified in this lease for payment of installments of the Fixed Rent, and Landlord shall be \nentitled to recover from Tenant each annual deficiency as the same arises.  No suit to collect the \ndeficiency for any month shall prejudice Landlord’s right to collect the deficiency for any \nsubsequent month.  Tenant shall not be entitled to any rents payable (whether or not collected) \nunder any reletting, whether or not those rents exceed the Rent. If Landlord relets the Premises, \nor any portion of the Premises, together with other space in the Building, the rents collected \nunder the reletting and the expenses of the reletting shall be equitably apportioned for the \npurposes of this Article.  \n(e) Landlord may recover from Tenant, and Tenant shall pay Landlord, on \nrequest, in lieu of any further deficiency pursuant to the preceding paragraph of this Section (as \nliquidated damages for such deficiency) the amount by which (i) the unpaid Rent for the period \nwhich otherwise would have constituted the unexpired portion of the Term (conclusively \npresuming the Addit io nal Rent for each year thereof to be the same as was payable for the year \nimmediately preceding the termination, re-entry or obtaining of possession) exceeds (ii) the then \nfair market rental value of the Premises, including the Addit ional Rent for the same period, both \ndiscounted to present value at an annual rate of interest equal to five (5%) percent.  If, before \npresentation of proof of liquidated damages, Landlord relets the Premises or any portion of the \nPremises for any period pursuant to a bona fide lease with an unrelated third party, the net rents \n(after deducting reletting costs) payable in connection with the reletting shall be considered to be \nthe fair market rental value for the Premises or the portion of the Premises relet during the term \nof the reletting.   \n(f) Tenant shall also pay Landlord, as additional damages, any expenses \nincurred by Landlord in connection with the termination, reentry or obtaining of possession, and \nthe reletting of the Premises, including all repossession costs, brokerage commissions, \nreasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, alteration costs and other expenses of preparing \nthe Premises for reletting.   \n\n \n \n 23 \n(g) Nothing contained in this lease shall be considered to limit or preclude the \nrecovery by Landlord from Tenant of the maximum amount allowed to be obtained as damages \nor otherwise by any Laws. \nSection 18.2 Tenant hereby waives (a) the service of any notice of intention to \nre-enter or obtain possession of the Premises or to institute any legal action in connection \ntherewith, except as provided in this lease and (b) on its own behalf and on behalf of all persons \nclaiming under Tenant, including all creditors, any rights Tenant and all such persons might \notherwise have under any Laws to redeem the Premises, to re-enter or repossess the Premises, or \nto restore this lease, after (i) Tenant is dispossessed pursuant to any Laws or by any Authority, \n(ii) Landlord reenters or obtains possession of the Premises, or (iii) the Expiration Date, whether \nby operation of law or pursuant to this lease.  The words “re-enter,” “re-entry” and “re-entered” \nas used in this lease shall not be considered to be restricted to their technical legal meanings. \nLandlord shall have the right to enjoin any Default and the right to invoke any remedy allowed \nby any Laws in addition to any remedies provided in this lease.  All remedies provided in this \nlease are cumulative and Landlord’s right to invoke, or the invocation of, any remedy shall not \npreclude Landlord from invoking any other remedy under this lease or under any and all Laws. \nSection 18.3 Landlord and Tenant each hereby waive trial by jury in any legal \naction brought by either party against the other in connection with this lease. If Landlord \ncommences any summary proceeding against Tenant, Tenant shall not interpose any \ncounterclaim in that proceeding (unless the failure to impose the counterclaim would preclude \nTenant from asserting in a separate legal action the claim which is the subject of the \ncounterclaim), and shall not seek to consolidate the proceeding with any other legal action. \nSection 18.4 Tenant expressly waives its right to bring any declaratory \njudgment action with respect to any provision of this Lease or with respect to any notice sent \npursuant to the provisions of this Lease.  Tenant expressly waives its right to obtain any type of \ninjunctive relief in connection to any provision of this Lease or with respect to any notice sent \npursuant to the provisions of this Lease.  Tenant expressly waives its right to make any \napplication for relief pursuant to First Nat. Stores, Inc. v. Yellowstone Shopping Center, Inc., 21 \nN.Y.2d 630 (1968), commonly referred to as a Yellowstone injunction.  Tenant’s breach of this \nparagraph, in any way, shall const itute a breach of substantial obligations of the tenancy, and \nshall be grounds for the immediate termination of this Lease, without any notice.  It is the \nexpress intention of the parties hereto that their disputes be adjudicated exclusively via summary \nproceedings. \nSection 18.5 If Tenant fails to comply with any of its obligations under this \nlease, Landlord may, at its option, cure such breach of this lease.  All costs and expenses, \nincluding reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred by Landlord in that connect ion \nshall be paid by Tenant to Landlord as Additional Rent within fifteen (15) days after Tenant is \nbilled therefor.  Reasonable attorneys’ fees shall be calculated by usage of the lodestar method. \nSection 18.6  Tenant shall also reimburse Landlord for all costs and expenses  \n(including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements), incurred by Landlord in connection \nwith a default by Tenant, including instituting, prosecuting and/or defending any legal action by \nor against Tenant whether a non-payment or holdover proceeding, or other proceeding, if \nLandlord prevails in such legal action, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate \n\n \n \n 24 \n(hereinafter defined).  Any attorneys’ fees shall be calculated at the prevailing market hourly \nrate, utilizing the lodestar method. \nSection 18.7 The failure of Landlord to seek redress for a Default, or of \nLandlord or Tenant to insist upon the strict performance of any term of this lease, shall not \nprevent Landlord from redressing a subsequent Default or Landlord or Tenant from thereafter \ninsisting on strict performance.  The receipt by Landlord of the Rent with knowledge of a \nDefault or Tenant’s failure to strictly perform under this lease shall not be deemed a waiver of \nthe Default or failure.  No term of this lease shall be considered waived by Landlord or Tenant \nunless the waiver is in a writing signed by the waiving party.  No payment by Tenant or receipt \nby Landlord of a lesser amount than the Rent shall be considered other than on account of the \nnext installment of the Rent, or as Landlord may elect to apply same.  No endorsement or \nstatement on any check or letter accompanying any check or payment shall prevent Landlord \nfrom cashing the check or otherwise accepting the payment, without prejudice to Landlord’s \nright to recover the balance of the Rent or pursue any other remedy. \nSection 18.8 If Tenant fails to pay any installment of the Fixed Rent or any \nAdditional Rent within five (5) days after the due date thereof, in addition to any other right or \nremedy of Landlord, Tenant shall pay to Landlord within fifteen (15) days following Landlord’s \ninvoice (a) a late charge equal to the greater of one hundred ($100.00) dollars and four (4%) \npercent of the amount unpaid and (b) interest at the rate (the “Default Rate”) of twelve (12%) \npercent per annum on the amount unpaid, from the date the payment was first due to and \nincluding the date paid and, (c) and Landlord’s bank charges for the return of any Tenant’s \ncheck. \nSection 18.9 All legal actions relating to this lease shall be adjudicated in the \ncourts of the State of New York having jurisdiction in the county in which the Building is \nlocated.  Tenant irrevocably consents to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of those \ncourts in any legal action relating to this lease or any guaranty of Tenant’s obligations under this \nlease, and Tenant shall not assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any objection to \nany such court being the venue of such legal action or claim that such venue is an inconvenient \nforum for Tenant or any principal of Tenant.   \nArticle 19. Security \nSection 19.1 Tenant has deposited with Landlord, as security for Tenant’s \ncompliance with this lease, the Security, in cash.  If Tenant defaults in performing any of its \nobligations under this lease, Landlord may use all or any portion of the Security to cure such \nbreach or for the payment of any other amount due and payable from Tenant to Landlord in \naccordance with this lease. If Tenant shall, during any twelve (12) month period, twice be in \nbreach of its obligation to pay Rent on the first of the month, Tenant shall promptly after \nLandlord’s request, remit to Landlord an amount equal to six months of the then current amount \nof the monthly installment of Fixed Rent so that the amount of Security required under this lease \nshall then be equal to eight months’ of then current Fixed Rent.  If Landlord uses all or any part \nof the Security, Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days following Landlord’s notice, deposit with \nLandlord an amount sufficient to restore the full amount of the Security. Landlord shall not, \nunless required by any Laws, pay interest to Tenant on the Security, and if Landlord is required \nto maintain the Security in an interest bearing account or pay any interest to Tenant, Landlord \nshall retain the maximum amount of interest permitted under any Laws (which Landlord may \n\n \n \n 25 \nwithdraw and retain annually or at any other times).  Tenant shall not assign or encumber the \nSecurity, and no prohibited assignment or encumbrance by Tenant of the Security shall bind \nLandlord.  Landlord shall not be required to exhaust its remedies against Tenant or the Security \nbefore having recourse to Tenant, any Guarantor, the Security or any other security held by \nLandlord, or before exercising any right or remedy, and recourse by Landlord to any one of \nthem, or the exercise of any right or remedy, shall not affect Landlord’s right to pursue any other \nright or remedy or Landlord’s right to proceed against the others.  If there is then no uncured \nbreach, the Security and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, or any balance, shall be paid or \ndelivered to Tenant promptly after the Expiration Date and Tenant’s vacating of the Premises in \naccordance with this lease.  If Landlord’s interest in the Real Property is sold or leased, Landlord \nshall transfer the Security and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, or any balance, to the \nnew Landlord and, upon such transfer, the assignor shall thereupon be automatically released by \nTenant from all liability for the return of the Security or any interest (and Tenant agrees to look \nsolely to the assignee for the return of the Security or any interest). \nSection 19.2 Notwithstanding any other provision of this lease to the contrary, \nTenant may, at any time except if a Default has occurred, substitute the cash Security with an \nirrevocable, unconditional, “clean”, “evergreen” (i.e. automatic renewal) letter of credit in form \nand substance acceptable to Landlord, issued by a federally insured bank with a Standard & \nPoor’s credit rating of at least AA, whose office for the presentation of a letter of credit to be \ndrawn upon is in Nassau County or New York City and is reasonably acceptable to Landlord.    \nTenant shall keep any such letter of credit, including without limitation such amendments or \nreplacements as are necessary to increase the amount of the letter of credit as the amount of the \nrequired Security increases and after Landlord has drawn on the letter of credit, in full force and \neffect for not less than sixty (60) days after the Expiration Date of the Term.  Landlord may draw \nupon the letter of credit in whole or in part and apply the proceeds for the same reasons, and in \nthe same manner, as the cash Security. In addition, Landlord may draw upon the letter of credit if \n(a) Tenant has not supplied an amendment or replacement at least ninety (90) days prior to (i) the \nexpiry date, if any, or (ii) the date on which the amount of  the letter of credit is required to be \nincreased; (b) Landlord asks the letter of credit issuer to confirm the current expiry date and the \nissuer does not do so within ten (10) days after Landlord’s request; (c) Tenant fails to pay any \nbank charges with respect to any Landlord transfer of the letter of credit; (d) the issuer ceases, or \nannounces that it will cease, to maintain an office in New York City where Landlord may present \ndraw requests; or (e) the letter of credit issuer has a credit rating by Standard & Poor’s of less \nthan AA and, within thirty (30) days following Landlord’s notification to Tenant that the letter of \ncredit issuer’s Standard & Poor’s credit rating is less than AA, Tenant has not provided Landlord \nwith a replacement letter of credit from an issuer with a Standard & Poor’s credit rating of at \nleast AA. Tenant shall not seek to enjoin, prevent or otherwise interfere with Landlord’s draw \nagainst the letter of credit. Tenant acknowledges that the only effect of an erroneous draw would \nbe to substitute cash Security for the letter of credit, which would not cause Tenant any legally \nrecognizable damage. The letter of credit shall provide that the letter of credit is freely \ntransferable by Landlord, its successors and assigns, as its beneficiary without payment by \nLandlord (or any subsequent transferee) of any fee or other consideration for such transfer. If \nLandlord transfers its interest in the Premises, Tenant shall, at Tenant’s expense, within ten (10) \ndays after receipt of Landlord’s request, deliver to Landlord or its transferee, an amendment to \nthe letter of credit naming Landlord’s transferee as substitute beneficiary of the letter of credit. \n\n \n \n 26 \nArticle 20. Broker \nSection 20.1 Tenant represents to Landlord that it has dealt with no broker in \nconnection with this lease.  Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord fro m and \nagainst any claims for any brokerage commissions or other compensation which are made by any \nbroker alleging to have dealt with Tenant in connection with this lease, and all costs, expenses, \nliabilities and damages in connection therewith, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and \nexpenses.  Landlord shall pay any commission due the Broker pursuant to a separate agreement \nbetween Landlord and the Broker.  Landlord shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Tenant \nfrom and against all claims, costs, expenses, liabilities and damages including reasonable \nattorneys’ fees and expenses (a) arising from Landlord’s failure to comply wit h its obligat ion in \nthe preceding sentence and (b) any claims for any brokerage commissions or other compensation \nby any broker (other than the Broker) with whom Landlord, but not Tenant, has had dealings in \nconnection with this lease.  \nArticle 21. Notices; Consents and Approvals \nSection 21.1 Except as may be provided in this lease, all notices and other \ncommunications under this lease must be in writing and sent by nationally recognized overnight \ncourier service or registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), addressed to Landlord or \nTenant at its Notice Address.  Either party may, by notice given in accordance with this Article, \ndesignate a different Notice Address, which address change shall become effective upon receipt, \nthe date rejected or the date of attempted delivery (if the receiving party is not present). \nSection 21.2 Any notice or other communication sent as provided in this Article \nshall be effective (a) on the date received, the date rejected, or the date of attempted delivery (if \nthe receiving party is not present) if sent by overnight courier service, or (b) three (3) business \ndays after mailing by registered or certified mail.   \nSection 21.3 If any provision of this lease requires Landlord’s consent or \napproval, such consent or approval shall be effective only if given in writ ing.  Notwithstanding \nany provision of this lease to the contrary, any type of Landlord’s consent shall be provided at \nthe sole discretion of the Landlord. \nSection 21.4 Any notice or other communication given by Landlord to Tenant in \naccordance with this Article may be signed and given by Landlord’s attorney or managing agent \nor other designee, if any, with the same force and effect as if signed and given by Landlord. \nArticle 22. No Representations; Liability; Tenant Indemnity \nSection 22.1 Landlord has not made any warranties, representations, statements \nor promises with respect to the Premises, the Real Property, the Building systems, any \nAdditional Rent, any Laws or any other matter, unless expressly set forth in this lease. This lease \ncontains the entire agreement between Landlord and Tenant with respect to the subject matter of \nthis lease, and any previous agreements between Landlord and Tenant are merged in this lease, \nwhich alone expresses their agreement.  Tenant is entering into this lease after full investigation, \nand is not relying on any warranties, representations, statements or promises made by Landlord \nor any other person not expressly set forth in this lease, and is not acquiring any rights of any \nnature, by implication or otherwise, except as expressly set forth in this lease. \n\n \n \n 27 \nSection 22.2 Any employee of Landlord, Landlord’s managing agent, if any, or \nthe Real Property to whom any property is entrusted by or on behalf of Tenant shall be deemed \nto be acting as Tenant’s agent with respect to that property and neither Landlord nor Landlord’s \nmanaging agent, if any, shall be liable for any damages to or loss of property of Tenant or others \nentrusted to employees, agents or contractors of Landlord, Landlord’s managing agent, if any, or \nthe Real Property. \nSection 22.3 Neither Landlord nor Landlord’s managing agent, if any, shall be \nliable for any injury, damage or loss to Tenant, Tenant’s Property, Tenant’s Work, Tenant’s \nbusiness or to any other person or property resulting from any cause, except to the extent caused \nby the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, Landlord’s managing agent, if any, or their \nrespective employees, agents or contractors, subject to Section 13.4. Tenant agrees to fully \ndefend and indemnify Landlord for any claim made against Landlord for injury, damage, or loss \narising out of Tenant’s use or occupation of the Premises, including any Tenant’s Work. \nSection 22.4 In the event of a transfer or lease of the entire Building (a) the \ntransferor or lessor shall be and hereby is relieved of all obligations and liabilities of Landlord \nunder this lease accruing after the effective date of the transfer or lease, and (b) the transferee or \nlessee shall be deemed to have assumed all of Landlord’s obligations and liabilities under this \nlease effective from and after the effective date of the transfer or lease. \nSection 22.5 In no event shall Landlord, its affiliates, agents, partners, members, \nmanagers, shareholders, officers, directors and principals, disclosed or undisclosed, be liable for \nincidental or consequential damages or have any personal liability under or in connect ion with \nthis lease.

In addition, Tenant shall be liable to Landlord for per diem use and occupancy in \nrespect of the Premises at a rate equal to twice the Rent payable under this lease for the last year \nof the Term (which Landlord and Tenant agree is the Rent that is contemplated by them as being \nfair and reasonable under such circumstances and is not a penalty).  In no event, however, shall \nthis Section be construed as permitting Tenant (and all other occupants) to remain in possession \nof the Premises after the Expiration Date. \n\n \n \n 29 \nSection 24.3 If during the last ninety (90) days of the Term, Tenant removes \nsubstantially all of Tenant’s Property from the Premises, Landlord or any person designated by \nLandlord may immediately enter and alter the Premises, without releasing Tenant from any \nobligation or liability under this lease, including the payment of Rent, or incurring any liability \nor obligation to Tenant. \nSection 24.4 Unless otherwise specifically provided:  (a) any obligation of \nLandlord or Tenant under this lease which by its nature or under the circumstances can only be, \nor by the terms of this lease may be, performed after the Expiration Date; (b) any liability for a \npayment with respect to any period ending on or before the Expiration Date; and, (c) all \nindemnity and hold harmless provisions in this lease, shall survive the Expiration Date. \nArticle 25.

VIRSIG’s design and engineering technology activities lends itself to the protection of organizations \nthrough innovative systems, custom-engineered software applications, specialized hardware (such as surveillance & access \ncontrol systems), and secure high-speed monitored networks. VIRSIG’s physical security programs include comprehensive \nevaluations of locations, special events, and other details which require a strong element of protection; these evaluations include \nthreat assessments, vulnerability analyses and crisis management planning.\nVIRSIG leverages the strength of the I.P. Network -- the backbone of any infrastructure or security system; this is accomplished \nfrom initial design to implementation, through analysis and testing, and subsequent monitoring.\nAs a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, information transport systems laden with peripherals (e.g. digital voice, data, \nvideo, sensory, imagery, etc.) are only as strong as the network they’re on.\nVIRSIG monitors these networks—large and small, ensuring information technology and business personnel have reliable and \ndependable 24 hour access to their information. By providing network performance monitoring for the customer, VIRSIG is in a \nposition to respond early to any situations that may arise, and can potentially mitigate down-time or minimize I.T. issues.\nPage: 2 of 11\nQuote #GT-001895 v2\n\nVIRSIG LLC\n95 Seaview Blvd\nSuite 201\nPort Washington, New York 11050\nwww.VIRSIG.com\n718-8196400\nScope of Work\nVIRSIG proposes to design, furnish, and install a comprehensive Milestone Corporate Video Surveillance System alongside a \nLENEL NetBox Physical Access Control System for Long Beach City Hall. This solution is tailored to enhance the security and \noperational oversight of the facility by leveraging cutting-edge technology in surveillance and access control.\nThe installation will comprise:\n\n24 High-Resolution Networked Surveillance Cameras: Strategically placed throughout City Hall to provide extensive \ncoverage of both interior and exterior areas. These cameras will offer high-definition video monitoring with real-time and \nrecorded viewing capabilities.\n\n20 Access-Controlled Door Openings: Equipped with electronic locks and controlled access readers, these points will \nensure that only authorized personnel can access restricted areas, significantly enhancing security and asset protection.\nTo ensure continuity and operational ease, both the Milestone Video Surveillance and LENEL NetBox Access Control Systems \nwill be fully integrated with the facility's existing Milestone and NetBox infrastructure. This integration will allow seamless \nmanagement through a single interface, reducing administrative complexity and enabling quick, centralized control over \nsurveillance footage and access permissions.\nIn addition to the installation, VIRSIG will provide:\n\nSystem Configuration and Testing: Ensuring all components function as intended within the existing setup.\n\nUser Training: Equipping designated personnel with the knowledge to efficiently operate and manage the new systems.\nThis comprehensive solution is designed to enhance Long Beach City Hall's security infrastructure, ensuring a safe, secure, and \nefficient environment for staff and visitors alike.\nServer Storage/Performance Calculations\nPage: 3 of 11\nQuote #GT-001895 v2\n\nVIRSIG LLC\n95 Seaview Blvd\nSuite 201\nPort Washington, New York 11050\nwww.VIRSIG.com\n718-8196400\nCameras\nProduct DetailsQtyMSRP PricePriceExt.

Specifically:\n l61 at the City Hall, such as at least one \nvan accessible parking space, accessible \nparking spaces with marked access aisles, \na main entrance with at least 18 inches of \nmaneuvering clearance on the latch side \nof the door and interior signs with raised \nlettering and Braille mounted on the latch \nside of office doors . \n l25 at the Community Center, such as curb \nramps with accessible slopes, a main \nentrance with a door closing speed of at \nleast five seconds and properly secured \ncarpets and restroom mirrors, soap \ndispensers and hand dryers mounted at an \naccessible height .\nRecommendations\nCity officials should assess the feasibility of \ntaking additional steps to increase physical \naccessibility for the 86 components identified in \nthis report . City officials agreed with our findings \nand indicated they plan to initiate corrective \naction .\nAudit Period\nJanuary 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024\nBackground\nThe City is located in Nassau County and \nis governed by an elected five-member \nCity Council (Council) and operates with a \ncouncil-manager form of government . The \nCity Manager is responsible for the overall \nadministration of the City’s government .\nThe City provides programs and services at \nthe City Hall, such as:\n lThe City Clerk’s Office (various licenses \nand permits, freedom of information act \nrequests, etc .),\n lThe Tax Department (collection of \nproperty taxes),\n lWater and Sewer Administration (billing \nand collection of water and sewer \ncharges),\n lPolice Department (separate entrance), \n lThe City Court, and\n lPublic meetings of the Council and \nZoning Board of Appeals, among others . \nThe Community Center (consisting of the \nRecreation Department and Senior Center) is \nalso accessible to the public .\nCity of Long Beach\nQuick Facts\nCity\nPopulation35,029\n2023 General Fund Expenditures$80 .6 Million\nNumber of Employees304\n\n2              Office of the New York State Comptroller  \nAccording to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, more than one in four adults in the United \nStates have some type of disability and more than one in 10 have a mobility disability with serious \ndifficulty walking or climbing stairs .\n1\n It is important that someone with a disability can participate in \ntheir local government’s decision-making process and be provided the same services and program \nopportunities as everyone else .\nTitle II of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability by state and local governments . Generally, under the ADA’s implementing regulations, a public \nentity may not deny the benefits of its programs, activities, and services to individuals with disabilities \nbecause its facilities are inaccessible . While not required to make each existing facility accessible, \npublic entities must operate each service, program, or activity so that, when viewed in its entirety, it is \nreadily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities .\nThe 2010 ADA Standard for Accessible Design (Standards) set minimum scoping and technical \nrequirements for newly designed and constructed or altered state and local government facilities, public \naccommodations, and commercial facilities . For any new construction or alteration that began on or \nafter March 15, 2012, the project must comply with the Standards . An alteration is defined as a change \nto a building or facility that affects or could affect the usability of the entire building or facility or a portion \nthereof . \nAlthough the Standards apply to new construction and alterations that began on or after March 15, \n2012, we used the Standards as a tool to help identify where City officials could consider taking \nadditional steps to increase physical accessibility to programs and services at selected existing \nstructures within the City, whether built before or after March 2012 . The potential improvements to \nphysical accessibility identified in this report, however, are intended for informational purposes only and \nshould not be construed as the Office of the State Comptroller (OSC) opining as to the legality of the \nCity’s compliance with ADA requirements .\nSteps Identified to Potentially Increase Physical Accessibility to Programs and Services \nat Selected City Facilities\nWe reviewed physical accessibility to programs and services provided at the City Hall and the \nCommunity Center, including access to City department offices, public meeting spaces and restrooms \nlocated within these buildings . \nWe also performed site visits at each of these buildings and their respective parking lots (together \n“facilities”) and used the ADA Checklist for Existing Facilities\n2\n (ADA Checklist), which incorporates the \nStandards, as a tool to assess the accessibility of the sampled facilities . \nPhysical Accessibility to Programs and Services\n1 https://www .cdc .gov/disability-and-health/articles-documents/disability-impacts-all-of-us-infographic .html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www .cdc .\ngov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all .html\n2 Produced by the New England ADA Center, the checklist was created to review existing facilities using the 2010 Standards for Accessible \nDesign: https://www .adachecklist .org/checklist .html . Similar to the use of the Standards, the checklist was used as a tool to identify potential \nimprovements to physical accessibility . The use of the checklist, however, is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as \nOSC opining on the legality of the City’s compliance with ADA requirements . \n\nOffice of the New York State Comptroller              3\nWe reviewed 500 applicable physical accessibility components at the selected facilities and identified \n86 components (17 percent) where City officials could consider taking additional steps to increase \nphysical accessibility, including 61 components at City Hall and 25 components at the Community \nCenter (Figure 1) .\nExamples of the potential improvements we identified and photographed at the facilities, along with a \ncomplete table of potential accessibility improvements, are included in Appendix B .\nWhat Do We Recommend? \n1 . City officials should assess the feasibility of taking additional steps to increase physical \naccessibility for the 86 components identified in this report . \nFIGURE 1\nPotential Physical Accessibility Improvements Identified at Selected City Facilities\nFigure 1: Potential Physical Accessibility Improvements Identified at Selected \nCit\ny Facilities \n \nCity Hall: 61 potential improvements, such as at least one van accessible \nparking space, accessible parking spaces with marked access aisles, a \nmain entrance with at least 18 inches of maneuvering clearance on the \nlatch side of the door, interior signs with raised lettering and Braille \nmounted on the latch side of office doors, interior office doors with \naccessible door handles that require no more than five pounds of force to \nopen and with a closing speed of no more than five seconds, a portion of \npublic service counters at an accessible height and at least one \nwheelchair accessible seating space in the courtroom.  \n \nCommunity Center: 25 potential improvements, such as at least one van \naccessible parking space, curb ramps with accessible slopes, a main \nentrance with a door closing speed of at least five seconds and properly \nsecured carpets, interior doors with at least 18 inches of maneuvering \nclearance on the latch side of the door and accessible thresholds, a \nportion of public service counters at an accessible height, restroom \nmirrors, soap dispensers and hand dryers mounted at an accessible \nheight, and pipes under lavatories covered to prevent injury from contact. \n \n\n4              Office of the New York State Comptroller  \nAppendix A: Response From City Officials\n\nOffice of the New York State Comptroller              5\n\n6              Office of the New York State Comptroller  \nAppendix B: Potential Physical Accessibility \nImprovements\nFIGURE 2\nPotential Physical Accessibility Improvement Examples\na\nFigure 2: Potential Physical Accessibility Improvement Examples\na \nParking spaces at the City Hall marked accessible with \nno access aisles. \nSigns in the City Hall without raised lettering or Braille \nand not mounted on the latch side of the door.\n \nOffice doors at City Hall have doorknobs instead of \naccessible handles such as latches or levers.\n \nTax Department payment window counter with no \naccessible portion.\n \na) Photos taken by OSC auditors in October 2024 with permission from local officials. \n \n\nOffice of the New York State Comptroller              7\nFigure 3: Potential Physical Accessibility Improvements by Component\nAccessibility Checklist \nComponent Category\nApplicable \nChecklist \nComponents \nReviewed\nPotential \nImprovements \nIdentified\nPercentage \nWith Potential \nImprovements \nIdentified\nAccessible Route3000%\nCurb Ramps1119%\nDrinking Fountains6117%\nElevators14214%\nEntrance6147%\nInterior Doors981818%\nLavatories42512%\nParking18317%\nRamps1119%\nRooms and Spaces3000%\nSales and Service Counters18844%\nSeating1119%\nSigns191579%\nSoap Dispensers and Hand Dryers12650%\nToilet Compartments (Stalls)2600%\nToilet Rooms (Bathrooms)27415%\nWater Closets (Toilets)661726%\nTotals5008617%\n\n8              Office of the New York State Comptroller  \nAppendix C: Audit Methodology and Standards\nWe conducted this audit pursuant to Article V, Section 1 of the State Constitution and the State \nComptroller’s authority as set forth in Article 3 of the New York State General Municipal Law . We \nobtained an understanding of internal controls that we deemed significant within the context of the audit \nobjective and assessed those controls . Information related to the scope of our work on internal controls, \nas well as the work performed in our audit procedures to achieve the audit objective and obtain valid \naudit evidence, included the following:\n lWe selected the City from a list of all cities, towns and villages (excluding NYC) not currently in \nOSC’s audit process at the time of selection . We divided the list into seven regions and used \nexpenditure data reported in the 2023 fiscal year to judgmentally select cities, towns and villages \nfrom these regions for an even representation across the State for this multi-unit audit .\n lWe reviewed applicable laws and regulations, as well as any policies and procedures the City \nhad regarding accessibility . The potential improvements to physical accessibility identified in the \nreport, however, are intended for informational purposes only and should not be construed as OSC \nopining as to the legality of the City’s compliance with ADA requirements .\n lWe interviewed City officials and staff and reviewed Council meeting minutes to gain an \nunderstanding of accessibility for the City’s programs and services . \n lWe reviewed accessibility to programs and services provided at City facilities, excluding \nrecreational programs and services provided by third parties . We used the ADA Checklist for \nExisting Facilities, which uses the 2010 ADA Standards, as a tool to review accessibility at the \nfacilities . We reviewed the accessibility components applicable at each sampled facility including \naccessible parking, approaches to buildings, building entrances, accessibility within buildings \nincluding to meeting rooms, offices providing programs and services, restrooms, and water \nfountains .\nWe conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing \nstandards (GAGAS) . Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, \nappropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our \naudit objective . We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and \nconclusions based on our audit objective .\nUnless otherwise indicated in this report, samples for testing were selected based on professional \njudgment, as it was not the intent to project the results onto the entire population . Where applicable, \ninformation is presented concerning the value and/or size of the relevant population and the sample \nselected for examination .\nThe Council has the responsibility to initiate corrective action . A written corrective action plan (CAP) \nthat addresses the findings and recommendations in this report should be prepared and provided to \nour office within 90 days, pursuant to Section 35 of General Municipal Law . For more information on \npreparing and filing your CAP, please refer to our brochure, Responding to an OSC Audit Report, which \nyou received with the draft audit report . We encourage the Council to make the CAP available for public \nreview in the City Clerk’s office .\n\nOffice of the New York State Comptroller              9\nAppendix D: Resources and Services\nRegional Office Directory \nwww .osc .ny .gov/files/local-government/pdf/regional-directory .pdf\nCost-Saving Ideas – Resources, advice and assistance on cost-saving ideas \nwww .osc .ny .gov/local-government/publications\nFiscal Stress Monitoring – Resources for local government officials experiencing fiscal problems \nwww .osc .ny .gov/local-government/fiscal-monitoring\nLocal Government Management Guides – Series of publications that include technical information \nand suggested practices for local government management \nwww .osc .ny .gov/local-government/publications\nPlanning and Budgeting Guides – Resources for developing multiyear financial, capital, strategic and \nother plans \nwww .osc .ny .gov/local-government/resources/planning-resources\nProtecting Sensitive Data and Other Local Government Assets – A non-technical cybersecurity \nguide for local government leaders  \nwww .osc .ny .gov/files/local-government/publications/pdf/cyber-security-guide .pdf\nRequired Reporting – Information and resources for reports and forms that are filed with the Office of \nthe State Comptroller  \nwww .osc .ny .gov/local-government/required-reporting\nResearch Reports/Publications – Reports on major policy issues facing local governments and State \npolicy-makers  \nwww .osc .ny .gov/local-government/publications\nTraining – Resources for local government officials on in-person and online training opportunities on a \nwide range of topics \nwww .osc .ny .gov/local-government/academy\n\nContact\nOffice of the New York State Comptroller \nDivision of Local Government and School Accountability \n110 State Street, 12th Floor, Albany, New York 12236\nTel: (518) 474-4037 • Fax: (518) 486-6479 • Email: localgov@osc .ny .gov\nhttps://www .osc .ny .gov/local-government\nLocal Government and School Accountability Help Line: (866) 321-8503\nSTATEWIDE AUDITS  –  Dina M .L .
